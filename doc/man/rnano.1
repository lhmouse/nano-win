.SH NAME

Pico clone

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rnano

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBrnano\fP command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invoke bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBnano\fP is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace
Pico, the default editor included in the non-free Pine package. Rather
than just copying Pico's look and feel, \fBnano\fP also implements some
missing (or disabled by default) features in Pico, such as "search and
replace" and "go to line number".
.PP
\fBrnano\fP is a restricted version of \fBnano\fP, which only edits
specific files and doesn't allow the user access to the filesystem or a
command shell.
