12/18/2000 - Nano 0.9.24 is released.  This versions contains the last of
		the security fixes for writing files, as well as for a
		nasty segfault when nano is unable to open a file for
		reading, among other fixes.  Nano also now cowardly
		refuses to open device files, to stop silly things like
		trying to open /dev/zero.  New features include being
		Able to use Meta-Meta-<key> as Control-<key>, better
		HURD support, and some new flags have been added for Pico
		compatibility.  Upgrading to this version is highly 
		recommended.

12/08/2000 - Nano 0.9.23 is the "race conditions bite" release.  The
		main reason for this release is the less-than-optimal
		fix for the security issue in nano with following symbolic
		links.  Hopefully this will fix the probelm permanently.  
		The --nofollow option also works again for those who
		are real security nuts.  There are also some display and
		search fixes, and the --disable-spell function was renamed
		to --disable-speller to be in line with nano and pico's
		"speller" term.

12/02/2000 - Nano 0.9.22 is released, with many more changes and 
		additions than imaginable.  The most important change is
		a fix for unsafe handling of symbolic links which could
		lead to symlink attacks if nano were to exit because
		of an error or signal.  Also there are better checks when
		saving files.
		    As for new features, username tab completion is
		now working well, the internal spell checker code has been
		tweaked, you can now unjustify if you don't like how the
		justify formatted your text, and there are more
		options for configure, including --disable-spell and
		--disable-justify and --enable-extra (for those who like
		surprises).  All in all, a whole lot of changes in
		a little over a week.

11/23/2000 - Happy Thanksgiving!  Nano 0.9.21 is our "last version was 
		a big turkey" release.  It fixes several bugs introduced
		by the previous version, as well as a few long-
		standing display bugs.  All 0.9.20 users are strongly
		encouraged to upgrade to this release.

11/18/2000 - Nano 0.9.20 is finally out the door.  Probably the biggest
		change is the brand new way nano displays previous search
		and replace strings (they are now editable!)  This is a
		break from Pico's (inconsistent) interface, so if you
		don't like the new way, "Pico" mode (-p on the command
		line or Meta-P within nano) still works the "old" 
		way.
		    Other new features include being able to deal with
		search strings of any length, a new internal spell feature
		(courtesy of Mr. Rocco Corsi) and tab completion when
		reading in or writing out files!  There's also the usual
		billion or so bug fixes.  Feedback on this release is
		welcome because so much much has changed, especially with
		the previous string display in search and replace. Email
		-> nano@nano-editor.org <-. If you like something, don't
		like something, or just want to order a pizza, let us know!

10/02/2000 - Nano 0.9.19 is the "Chris is getting married in less than
		a week and needs a distraction" release.  There are only
		a few actual code changes, mainly portability and compiler
		warning fixes.  Nano now also supports PDCurses, which
		enables easily-built nano executables for Windows NT
		and 95/98 for the brave.  The official nano site has
		changed (again) as well, check out www.nano-editor.org for
		all the latest nano schtuff.

09/18/2000 - Nano 0.9.18 is unleashed.  It has some new keyboard
		handling code, cygwin support out of the box, and 
		a more portable handler for the NOHELP toggle.  There
		is also a fix for a somewhat serious bug whereby trying
		to insert a directory instead of a normal file would
		destroy the contents of the editor.  A must-see.  Four
		stars.

09/04/2000 - Nano 0.9.17, the Labor Day release, is released after a
		quiet spell (almost an entire month since last release!)
		New features include better (not yet perfect) binary
		display support and toggle support for most of the program
		flags (M-c, M-i, M-z, M-x, M-p, M-w, M-m, M-k and M-e for
		-c, -i, -x, -p, -w, -k, and -R).

08/09/2000 - Nano 0.9.16, after some struggling, is release.  This release
		should fix a few of the holes that 0.9.15 dug.  The 
		"cutting text on the first line" bug is fixed, as is the
		"cutting text on the last line" bug.  Nice symmetry there
		huh?  Also the --tabsize argument should now work as well
		as by using -T.

08/03/2000 - Nano 0.9.15 is the "I cant think of a release description"
		release.  There are the usual gala of display bugfixes,
		a for the the nasty bug in -k mode that could create a
		loop in the file being edited, and some other code
		cleanup.  Also, the -T option should now work regardless
		of the curses library used.  Yay.

07/27/2000 - Nano 0.9.14 is officially the "13 is so unlucky it should
		be skipped as a version number" release.  One typo
		caused unending problems (calling nano with either -t or
		-k caused both flags to be used). The -k code is also now
		closer in functionality to Pico's -k mode, please
		note that this code is not finished yet.  Working on this
		code has made me realize that there is not enough 
		abstraction in the code, and I will be working on that
		for the next release.  Until then, have fun with this
		version.

07/23/2000 - Nano 0.9.13 has a few new bits and bobs, most notably the
		-k option from Pico (cut to end of line).  The majority
		of changes in this release are bugfixes however, including
		the usual display fixes and fixes for writing to symbolic
		links and un-writeable files.  Barring any other major 
		changes, this should be the feature set for nano 1.0,
		whenever it might be released =-)

07/07/2000 - Nano 0.9.12 (The "lucky day" release) is bursting with new
		features, bug fixes, and yummy fruit flavor.  For
		changes, the alternate replace keystroke ^W^T is now
		^W^R to be compatible with later version of Pico.
		^W^T is now goto line, again for Pico compatibility.
		As for new features, the wonderful/hated magic line
		code has returned with a vengeance!  Also, regular
		expression searches and replaces have been incorporated
		via the -R flag.  And of course there are the usual
		helping of display and other bug fixes to top it all
		off.

06/20/2000 - Nano 0.9.11 presents drastic rewrites of the most buggy
		routines in the program, specifically the wrapping code
		and almost all of the display routines.  There are many
		improvements and bugfixes to the display subsystem in 
		general, but there may be bugs lurking yet.  Also, after
		many MANY requests, there is now an option to set the
		displayed tab width (-T, --tabsize).  Note that 
		this function just changes the way tabs LOOK in the
		editor, the tabs you input are still real tabs of normal
		width  (usually 8 characters); nano just makes them look
		smaller or bigger whlie in the editor.  New in the
		translation department is an indonesian translation (id).

06/06/2000 - Nano 0.9.10 is primarily a bugfix for the loss of SIGINT when
		using "run and terminate" flags (for example, --help).
		There are also some minor documentation updates.  This
		version of nano is the most stable in quite some time, and
		is likely to be the most stable for awhile.  Users are
		encouraged to upgrade to this version.

05/31/2000 - Nano 0.9.9 introduces much better working i18n support,
		more portability, and a ton of bugfixes.  While
		nano is not likely anywhere near 1.0 in terms of
		code quality, it gets a quantum leap closer with this
		release.

05/18/2000 - Nano 0.9.8 (the 'what broke now?' release) should fix
		the resize crash people have been experiencing.  It also
		offers a new input method that should allow nano to do
		things the right way (like ^S, ^Q, custom suspend keys)
		and hopefully wont break with non-US keyboards.  There
		are also the obligatory display fixes and speedups.  Have
		fun with it.

05/14/2000 - Nano 0.9.7 (the Mother's Day release) continues in the long
		line of display fixes, and also fixes the broken symlink
		behavior (i.e. symlinks weren't being followed by
		default).  Hopefully all major bugs can be worked out soon
		and we can have a 1.0 release before the end of the year,
		but who knows.
 
05/08/2000 - Nano 0.9.6 cleans up a lot of the display bugs that 0.9.5
		uncovered.  There are improvements (and some remaining
		segfaults) in the wrapping code, and even more
		display optimizations.  I would still say 0.9.4 or 0.9.2
		are the most stable versions of nano to date, but this one
		may not be too bad =-)

05/01/2000 - Nano 0.9.5 attempts to speed up the display of text
		to be at least somewhat reasonable.  Much
		code profiling has been done to reduce the 
		rediculous number of redundant display updates.  This
		will probably expose a lot of bugs that can then be
		fixed, so this release is probably not for the faint
		of heart.  For anyone curious, I would call nano 0.9.2
		the most stable version recently, so use that if you're
		not particularly concerned with being on the bleeding
		edge.

04/25/2000 - Nano 0.9.4 fixes some problems in 0.9.3 with the last
		line code and related segfaults.  It also now has
		much better handling for 8-bit characters.  The
		--enable-tiny code also produces a smaller executable.

04/19/2000 - Nano 0.9.3 is officially the "Micro$oft" release.  It
		underscores the recent problem of bugfixes introducing
		more bugs than they fix.  The most important change
		to this version of nano is the removal of the "magic
		line".  You will no longer see a blank line at the end of
		the file. If you want a new line at the end of your file,
		you'll have to hit enter to get one.  

		NOTE: THIS BREAKS COMPATIBILITY WITH PICO.  Unfortunately,
		this feature has been causing many many problems with nano
		so it is being removed for the time being, and perhaps
		indefinitely.

		Other new stuff includes a --emable-tiny option to make
		nano ultra small (disabling i18n, detailed help and the
		marker and mouse code), and --with-slang to use the 
		slang libraries instead of ncurses.

04/15/2000 - Nano 0.9.2 just fixes the serious segfault problem if 
		nano is invoked any way other than using the absolute 
		path.  The bug was in the new code for checking whether 
		nano is invoked as pico.

04/14/2000 - 0.9.1 has some more Pico compatibility built-in.  The
		option to switch to/from Search and Search/Replace
		(^T) is now available, and nano now displays the 
		more Pico-like shortcut list when invoked as 'pico'
		(i.e. if pico is a symlink to nano).  There is an
		important change to the handling of symbolic links
		as well.  Now, nano does the "correct" thing and
		automatically writes to the object of the symlink,
		rather than replace the symlink with the updated file.
		This behavior is still available with the --nofollow
		or -l flags.  
		    Other new things include a fix for the infamous
		"recursive replace" bug, and more bugfixes in the wrapping 
		code.  

04/07/2000 - Nano 0.9.0 has some updates, new language support and
		a much better refresh setup (It's still not great, but...)
		There should also be more stabillity editing long lines,
		as there was a stupid mistake in the update_line
		call.  Silly me =)

03/22/2000 - Nano 0.8.9 is basically just a bugfix release of 0.8.8
		to reflect the current stagnant status of the project.
		Most things work, the rest doesn't doesn't work because
		(a) I can't fix it or I would have already done so, and
		(b) the amount of patches I'm receiving right now is quite
		negligible.  Forrunately this release marks the first
		release since I have acquired ownership of the nano pages
		on SourceForge.  Here's hoping SF will get us some more
		visibilitiy, translators and patches.

03/12/2000 - After a hiatus, I have finally moved (not unpacked though)
		to my new home into albany. Thus I should now have more
		time to work on nano.  Nano 0.8.8, the "dear god what
		broke this time?" release, incorporates patches for both
		i18n and many bugfixes.  It is VERY likely something broke 
		this version, and it's likely I didn't even apply the i18n
		stuff properly, so *it* may not even work.  

		I would like to announce that I'm going to need
		translations soonish, so if you are fluent in other
		languages than english (or even better, if your native
		language is not english) and you would like to submit a
		translation file to me, please feel free to do so.  If you
		do, I will list your name and email in the AUTHORS file as
		the maintainer of the .po file, and from then on it is
		yours to take care of and keep up to date.

03/01/2000 - Well, to continue my trend of going back on my previous
		release's comments, nano 0.8.7 is released.  The crashing
		behavior was still occuring, and this most recent fix also
		fixes some other wrapping problems, so here you go.
		There may be another relase soon, there may not be, is
		that vague enough? =)

02/25/2000 - More minor bugfixes in 0.8.6, the bizarre behavior at the end
		of a page has ceased, thankfully.  I'm also moving next
		weekend, so don't be shocked if you don't see a new
		version of nano next week =-)

02/11/2000 - Okay, here we go again.  Aside from a few minor fixes and
		some under-the-hood changes, you won't notice much
		different in this version of nano.  I haven't gotten much
		feedback on the help feature, is it simply amazing or does
		no one care?  Write and let me know! =)

02/08/2000 - Nano 0.8.3 marks the first time in a long time that there has
		been more than three days since the last release.  New
		features include an initial help mode (YAY!), hopefully
		much more support for i18n out of the box, and a flag
		for more Pico compatibility in the shortcut lists
		displayed. This release also marks the new nano
		distribution site, http://www.asty.org/nano and email
		address nano@asty.org for bugs, etc.

02/02/2000 - Okay, I hate to go back on what I said in the last release,
		but I may be changing jobs very soon.  I will release
		version 0.8.2 as is (no i18n, no help menu (yet).  I
		expect things to settle down by the end of next week, and
		then I can try to start on the i18n support and help menu,
		look for these new features in version 0.8.5 to 0.9.0.

01/28/2000 - Nano 0.8.1 marks our first official step toward
		internationaliation (i18n) and the help system (^G).  I
		will be merging in Jordi's patches for initial i18n in the
		next version, and will implement the help system with
		i18n built into it shortly after that.  Please don't
		hesitate to send bug reports, as long as you're sure the
		fault lies with nano =-).

01/25/2000 - Nano 0.8.0 is officially the 'let's try and be at least a
		little portable, mmmmkay?' release.  There are many
		portability checks and fixes, many thanks to Andy Kahn for
		his patches.  I removed the broken do_spell behavior with
		the 'spell' program, for now we only try to call 'ispell'
		until I write a better method to handle the output of the
		normal 'spell' command.

01/24/2000 - Nano 0.7.9 features many new features. Among them are a
		new autoindent feature (-i, --autoondent), tempfile
		flag like Pico's -t flag (-t, --tempfile), and preliminary
		spelling program support.  The spelling function tries
		to run 'spell' and then 'ispell' in that order, but you
		can specify another spelling program with -s or --speller.

01/17/00 - Nano 0.7.7 is officially the 'way too much stuff changed this
		release' release.  It's the busy time at work for me, so
		please don't get offended if your patch doesn't get
		included in the next immediate version of nano.  I'm sure
		all the changes in this release will cause a few bugs, so
		0.7.8 will primarily be about fixing those bugs.

		Things added this release include resizeability (kinda),
		new -x and -c flags (see nano -h for help), long command
		line flag support, and the usual array of bugfixes.

01/15/00 - Nano 0.7.6 is officially the 'lightning' release.  It now loads
		large files much faster than previous versions, and is
		even much faster than Pico or vi in some rather
		rudimentary tests. Many thanks to Adam Rogoyski for the
		read_byte patch!

01/09/00 - As of this version (0.7.4), TIP has officially been renamed
		to nano.  The new homepage is at
		http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/astyanax/nano.  Please
		update your bookmarks, tell your friends, and all that
		jazz.
