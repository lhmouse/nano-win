	GNU nano - an enhanced clone of the Pico text editor.
                                      
Overview

     The nano project was started because of a few "problems" with the
     wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor.

     First and foremost is its license: the Pine suite does not use the
     GPL or a GPL-friendly license, and has unclear restrictions on 
     redistribution.  Because of this, Pine and Pico are not included with
     many GNU/Linux distributions.  Also, other features (like goto line
     number or search and replace) were unavailable until recently or
     require a command line flag.  Yuck.

     nano aims to solve these problems by emulating the functionality of
     Pico as closely as possible while addressing the problems above and
     perhaps providing other extra functionality.

     The nano editor is now an official GNU package.  For more information
     on GNU and the Free Software Foundation please see http://www.gnu.org.
     
How to compile and install nano

     Download the nano source code, then:
     tar zxvf nano-x.y.z.tar.gz
     cd nano-x.y.z
     ./configure
     make
     make install
     
     It's that simple. Use --prefix with configure to override the 
     default installation directory of /usr/local.

Mailing List and Bug Reports

	SourceForge hosts all the nano-related mailing-lists.
	+ nano-announce@lists.sourceforge.net is a very low traffic list
	  used to announce new Nano versions or other important information
	  about the project.
	+ nano-devel@lists.sourceforge.net is the list used by the people
	  that make Nano and a general development discussion list, with
	  moderate traffic.
	To subscribe, send email to nano-<name>-request@lists.sourceforge.net
	with a subject of "subscribe", where <name> is the list you want to
	subscribe to.
	For general bug reports, send a description of the problem to
	nano@nano-editor.org or directly to the development list.

Current Status

	GNU nano has finally reached its first stable release (1.0).
	The 1.1 development tree has forked and is proceeding nicely.
	There will be releases and updates for both the 1.1 and
	1.0 trees until 1.1 stabilizes and becomes version 1.2.
