.SH NAME
nano \- Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico Clone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nano
.RI [options]\ [+LINE] " file"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B nano
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBnano\fP is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace
Pico, the default editor included in the non-free Pine package. Rather
than just copying Pico's look and feel,
.B nano
also implements some missing (or disabled by default) features in Pico,
such as "search and replace" and "goto line number".

.SH NOTES
Nano will try to dump the buffer into an emergency file in some cases.
Mainly, this will happen if Nano recieves a SIGHUP or runs out of
memory, when it will write the buffer into a file named "nano.save" if the
buffer didn't have a name already, or will add a ".save" suffix to the
current finename. Nano will \fBnot\fP write this file if a previous one
exists in the current directory.
