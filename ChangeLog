nano-0.9.11 - 06/20/2000
- New flag "-T" or "--tabsize" to specify how to display tab widths.
  Affects main() in nano.c, strlenpt(), xpt() and actual_x() (et al) in

	  text again.
- cut.c:
	- totsize fixes (Rob Siemborski)
- nano.c:
	- experimental do_wrap and check_wrap (Adam Rogoyski)

	  a resize wasn't picking up on possible different width correctly.
- utils.c:
	- Moved nmalloc() and nrealloc() here.
- move.c:
	- New file, contains movement functions (like do_home(), do_up(),
	  do_down(), page_up(), etc...).

nano-0.9.10 - 06/04/2000
- es.po:
	- Translation updates (Jordi).
- AUTHORS, nano.1.html, TODO, README:
	- Documentation and email address updates (Jordi).
- nano.c:
  main():
	- Moved Adam's termio code down to after getopt() and before initscr()
	  to stop people losing their SIGINT character when using args that
	  exit nano before it runs (--version, --help, etc).

nano-0.9.9 - 05/31/2000
- Makeile.am:
	- Added proper lines for defining LOCALEDIR.
- configure.in:
	- Spelling fixes (Jordi Mallach)
	- Removed CFLAGS changes for gcc, reduces portability according to
	  some, and it certainly doesn't seem to decrease exe size.
- es.po:
	- Spanish ranslation updates (Jordi Mallach)
- POTFILES.in:
	- Added global.c file, was screwing up translations (i.e. they
	  weren't getting done).

  add_to_cutbuffer():
	- Added totsize increment.
	- Cut fixes and optimizations (Rob Siemborski).
  do_uncut_text():
	- Added totsize increment in several places.
- nano.c:
  headers:
	- Removed LOCALEDIR define.
  do_justify():
	- Added edit_refresh() call (bug discovered by Adam).
  page_down_center():
	- Added call to edit_update(current) for last case.  Removed 
	  increment of current_y since it's now just wasteful.
  do_enter():
	- Added totsize increment.
  renumber(), renumber_all():
	- Removed totsize-- and totsize init in renumber_all.
  do_mouse():
	- Added edit_refresh() call to show hilight updates.  Removed
	  unnecessary wrefresh(edit).
  main():
	- Moved up locale calls so that translated --help messages would
	  actually get translated.
  do_backspace(), do_delete():
	- Added decrement of totsize.
  init_help_msg():
	- New function, initializes help text if NANO_SMALL isn't set (fixes
	  broken i18n).
  read_file():
	- malloc call changed to nmalloc (Rob Siemborski).
- winio.c:
  total_refresh():
	- Completely rewrote function, not quite so braindamaged now.

nano-0.9.8 - 05/18/2000
- nano.c:
  main():
	- Added awesome code that disables the CINTR and CQUIT 
	  character (Adam Rogoyski).  Removed raw()/noraw() calls so that
	  nano gets input in 'normal' mode, which is the Right Way(tm) to
	  do it. ^S, ^Z and ^Q now work properly as a result, as well as
	  ^C.  New variable term, global bariable oldterm to save previous
	  term settings, and changes to finish() and die().
	- Added extra #ifdefs in getopt code, so that above code and
	  flag init is run even if GETOPT_LONG is not #defined.
	- Added memset line before sigactions. (Adam Rogoyski)
  do_suspend():
	  Removed function, see above for why.
- winio.c:
  update_line(), center_cursor():
	- Removed wrefresh(edit) from bottom of functions.  wrefresh
	  should now only be called once, at the bottom of the main()
	  loop.
- global.c:
   shortcut_init():
	- Removed suspend sc_init call and suspend message because suspend is no
	  longer needed in the shortcut list to work properly.
    
nano-0.9.7 - 05/14/2000
- nano.c:
  do_home(), do_end(): 
	- Added calls to update_line for the current line, fixes
	  lack of update (bug discovered by Alberto García).
  main():
	- Added SET(FOLLOW_SYMLINKS) before getopt call, fixes not 
	  following symlinks even when -l isn't set, and "no changes"
	  error when nano is called from crontab -e (Adam Rogoyski).
- cut.c:
  do_cut_text():
	- Added edit_update_top to cut when mark is set, fixes lack of
	  display update (bug discovered by Ken Tyler).

nano-0.9.6 - 05/08/2000
- New Italian translation (it.po), by Daniele Medri.
- nano.c:
  page_up(), page_down():
	- Added reset of placewewant to 0, as it should be.
  do_up(), do_down():
	- Added call to update_line() for line we move from and line we
	  move to, in order to keep the highlighting correct.
  do_wrap():
	- Added var chop, new code to wrap lines more like Pico, mostly.
	  THIS STILL DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN!
- winio.c:
  do_help():
	- Added edit_refresh() before exit.
  update_cursor():
	- Removed cursor updating which really wasn't needed anyway.
  edit_update():
	- Removed yucky code that didn't work, this function now just
	  computes edittop and editbot and calls edit_refresh() to do the
	  rest, which removes a lot of dupliicate code..  
  
nano-0.9.5 - 05/01/2000
- Removed bytes from file struct because it was computationally wasteful.
- cut.c:
  do_uncut_text():
	- Added call to edit_refresh().
- nano.c:
  do_backspace():
	- Added reset of editbot when deleting the last line of the file
	  (bug discovered by Adam).
  do_char():
	- Removed call to reset_cursor().
  do_delete():
	- Added similar check as to do_backspace().
  do_enter():
	- Added call to edit_refresh().
  do_left(), right():
	- Added call to update_line(), still redundant but better...
  do_up(), do_down():
	- Added refresh calls both for current line and line to which
	  we are moving.
  main():
	- Removed inefficient call to edit_refresh() after every keystroke.
	  It is now up each function to leave the screen in a good state.
- winio.c:
  do_cursorpos()
	- Rewritten to not use bytes from filestruct by an incremental sum.
  update_line(), reset_cursor():
	- Optimized calls to xplustabs() through a single variable.
	- update_line() now takes a new arg, an index into the string
	  for where to update the line from.  Needed for new update
	  code.
- configure.in:
	- Better checks for slang, allows argument to --with-slang.
	  (Albert Chin-A-Young)
	- Removed -Iintl from CFLAGS in gcc check.
- Makefile.am:
	- Addition of -Iintl for gettext (Albert Chin-A-Young)

nano-0.9.4 - 04/25/2000
 - Fixed calls to no_help and changed them to the more consistent
   ISSET(NO_HELP).  Fixed return val of no_help to be what it should (2,
   not 1.  Code to temporarily disable NO_HELP when in the
   help system. (Adam Rogoyski)
- cut.c:
  do_marked_cut(), do_cut(), do_uncut():
	- Commented out unnecessary bits when NANO_SMALL is being used.
- winio.c:
  xpt(), strlenpt(), actual_x():
	- Added check for value of data[i] & 0x80, if so do not make
	  character 2 chars wide (orig. by Chris, 0x80 check by Adam).
  edit_refresh():
	- New check for temp == NULL (bad thing), if so go back to the
	  previous line.  New filestruct var hold points to prev line.
	  Fixes segfault when paging down to the end of a file.
- nano.c:
  write_file():
	- Added check for if file exists and is not equal to the current
	  filename, prompt for overwrite (Adam Rogoyski).
  do_down():
	- Removed check for current->next == NULL, now checks return value
	  of do_down before setting current_x = 0 (discovered by Adam).
  do_justify():
	- Fixed segfault when reaching the last line (tried to assign
	  currrent->next->data when current->next == NULL) (discovered
	  by Adam).
- utils.c:
	- Removed extra macro defs that are now in nano.h.
- nano.h:
	- Changed macro SET() to use |= instead of ^=.  Fixes bug in
	  cut code when cutting more than one line, and cutbuffer gets
	  blown away when it shouldnt.  

nano-0.9.3 - 04/29/2000
- cut.c:
  do_marked_cut():
	- Fixed off by one error in cut code for marked text.
  do_cut_text():
	- Removed check for being on the last line, part of
	  magic line code.
  add_to_cutbuffer():
	- Moved tmp->prev = inptr line to part where cutbuffer != NULL.
	- Added inptr->prev = NULL for case where cutbuffer == NULL.
- nano.c:
  do_backspace(), do_char():  
	- Removed "magic line" code.  It was basically causing more bugs
	  than it was helping for the sake of compatibillity.  This fixes
	  at least one known segfault condition.
  do_enter():
	- Added setting editbot to new node if the new node is the last
	  node in the file.
  write_file():
	- Changed writing file bahavior.  Now, if last line of the file
	  has any data on it, we write a newline on it, else we dont.
- winio.c:
  add_marked_sameline():
	- New code that checks for whether the begin and end of the marker
	  are on different lines.  Missing previously.
  edit_add():
	- added some more checks for text length.  Cleaned up some mvwaddnstrs that
	  could be written more simply as waddnstrs.
  edit_refresh():
	- Removed check for temp == filebot, it is now treated like any other line.
	  Fixes a bug where selected text on the last line shows normally.
  xpt():
	- Removed an extra computation for tabs variable that was incorrect.
  xplustabs():
	- Since xpt now actualy works, this func is now just a wrapper for
	  xpt(current, current_x)
- nano.1, nano.1.html:
	- Added -l option to man pages.
- configure.in:
	- New option --enable-tiny, #defines NANO_SMALL in config.h.  
	  Disables call to gettext in functions and other i18n stuff in 
	  nano.c, the detailed help mode, the resize functions, and the 
	  justify code which no one ever uses.
	- New option --with-slang.  Enables slang libraries instead of
	  ncurses, requires slcurses.h for wrapper functions. (Based
	  on patches for 0.8.7 by Glenn McGrath).

nano-0.9.2 - 04/15/2000
- This release just fixes the serious segfault problem if nano is 
  invoked any way other than using the absolute path.  The bug was
  in the new code for checking whether nano is invoked as pico.

nano-0.9.1 - 04/14/2000
- Added pico compatibility for ^T when in search or switch to switch
  to the opposite function.  Added one to REPLACE_LIST_LEN and 
  WHEREIS_LIST_LEN in nano.h, new args to sc_init_one in global.c and
  new strings that will have to be gettex()ed.  New argument 'replacing'
  to search_init().  Handlers in do_replace and do_search().
- New write code, now follows symbolic links instead of replacing them
  with the new file.  New option (-l, --nofollow) to enable the old
  (incorrect, but secure) behavior (Adam Rogoyski).
- nano.c:
  do_wrap():	
	- Fixed another bug relating to wrapping, and which would cause
	  a segfault *sigh*.
  do_replace(): 
	- Incremented current_x by the length of the replacement
	  text inside the main repalce loop.  Fixes bug #15.
  add_marked_sameline():
	- New function, handles marked text when start & end of marker is
	  on one line, also supports most marked text when cursor > COLS.
  main():
	- Code to check if nano is invoked as 'pico', and if so
	  automatically set pico_msgs (Robert Jones).

nano-0.9.0 - 04/07/2000
- nano.1, nano.1.html: 	Updated man page with my email address and homepage.
- winio.c:
  reset_cursor(), update_line():	
	- Changed update algorithm for x value to (COLS - 7) multiple when x
	  value > (COLS - 2).
- edit_refresh():
	- Removed inner loop code, now calls update_line() for each line
	  in question, MUCH nicer.
- xplustabs(), xpt():
	- Removed redundant increment of tabs when collumn no % 8 == 0.
	- Added check for data[i] < 32, most of such bits are 2 chars wide.
- update_line():
	- Fixed a stupid call to strlenpt with col when we should have
	  been using actual_col.  Ugh.

nano-0.8.9 - 03/22/2000
- nano.c:
  empty_line(), no_spaces(), justify_format(), do_justify():
		Actually added these (screwup applying patch).
  do_justify():	Added call to set_modified().

nano-0.8.8 - 03/12/2000
- Preliminary internationalization support.  Many many functions modified
  to use gettext (via _() macro).  es.po file included. (Jordi Mallach)
  New dirs po/ and intl/, changes to configure.in and Automake.am to
  support i18n.
- nano.c:
  includes:	Ddded sys/param.h and limits.h. (Adam Rogoyski).
  statics: 	Changed some things that were not necessarily static 
		(Adam Rogoyski).
  nrealloc():	New function, similar to nmalloc().  Changed calls from
		realloc() to nrealloc (Adam Rogoyski).
  empty_line(), no_spaces(), justify_format(), do_justify():
		New functions for justify function (Adam Rogoyski).
- winio.c:
  blank_edit():	Added wrefresh call to edit so that screen updates (like
		on ^L) actually work.
  xplustabs(), xpt(), strlenpt(): Fixed off-by-one buglets (Adam Rogoyski).

nano-0.8.7 - 03/01/2000
- main.c:
  do_wrap():	Better fix for segfaults, and fix for lisnes being wrapped 
		to a single character on one line when no good place to 
		break the line exists, and for wrapping lines longer than COLS.
- nano.1.html:
		Html version of man page, now included in dist.  For
		the benefit of nano packages in Linux distributions.

nano-0.8.6 - 02/24/2000
- gobal.c:
  shortcut_init():
		Added shortcuts for goto_line and do_replace when using
		pico_msgs.  Oops.
- nano.c:
  statics:	Changed fill back to 0 from 71 by default (Adam Rogoyski).
  do_wrap():	Added check for backing up past tabs, which we shouldnt do.
		Removed check for backing up past spaces first.
  main():	Added for loop to check for alt keys instead of hard list.
  do_enter():	Fix for bug #14, added call to reset_cursor and messed
		up do_char quite a bit.
  version():	Added time and date stamp for compile on version message.
		Added mail and web page info.
- README:	Updated mailing list info.

nano-0.8.5 - 02/18/2000
- nano.c:
  main():	Finally fixed tilde being input on page up/down keys in
		certain terminal types.  Fix was input 26->91->5[34] check
		for 126, if so make the kbinput PAGE UP/DOWN, else unget
		the keystroke and continue.  Added #include <ioctl.h> for
		ioctl call.
  handle_hup():
		Handler for hangup signal.  Belated include of patch from
		Tim Sherwood.
- winio.c:
  edit_refresh():
		Temporary fix for selecting text when temp == current.
		edit_refresh() is now unmanagably complex, and must be
		revamped.
  check_statblank():
		Added check for constupdate, makes things less choppy
		(Adam Rogoyski)

nano-0.8.4 - 02/11/2000
- Moved global variables that were only (or mostly) used in one file into
  its proper file as a static.  Affects cut.c, nano.c, global.c (Andy Kahn).
- global.c:	
  shortcut_init():
		Removed redundant NANO_CONTROL_H from backspace shortcut,
		added char 127 which should have been there.
- nano.c:
  main():	Fix for loops looping until MAIN_LEN, added -1 to stop
		segfaults (Adam Rogoyski).
- Makefile.am:	Added all source filenames (Adam Rogoyski).
- nano.1:	Fixed mail addressed and added mailing list address.
- README:	Updated my email address and the nano web page.

nano-0.8.3 - 02/08/2000
- New pico mode (-p, --pico), toggles (more) compatibility with the
  Pico messages displayed in the shortcut list.  Note that there are still
  small differences in this mode.
- nano.h:	New shortcut struct format, for the benefit of i18n and
		our help menu.  Removed shortcut message macros, they are
		now all in shortcut_init in global.c.
- nano.c:
  do_wrap():	Removed resetting of current_x when we are in fact
		wrapping to the next line, fixes a bug in -i mode.
  do_enter():
		Rewrote the autoindent mode code to be a lot less pretty,
		but a lot more magical.
  main():
		Removed case for ignoring char 126 (~).  That's kind of
		important, we'll have to fix handling that sequence when
		pageing up/down on a terminal some other way... Revamped
		main switch loop in much snazzier fashion based on the
		shortcut list.
- winio.c:
		New function display_main_list.  Affects all functions
		that used to call bottombars() with main_list.  Added
		because we now only call bottombars with the macro
		MAIN_VISIBLE instead of MAIN_LIST_LEN, because of the
		changes to the main_list shortcut list (see global.c below).
		New function do_help, our preliminary dynamic help system.
- Many many funcs:
		Changed from int to void to allow one uniform type to call
		from the shortcut struct.  Also a few functions that do
		not simple have void argument have new functions called
		funcname_void(void) to be called from the shortcut list.
		do_cut_text and do_uncut_text were changed to void
		arguments because they were never called with a filestruct
		other than *current anyway.
- global.c:
		Shortcut list main_list was expanded to cover all
		shortcuts that could be caught in the main loop.
		Consequently there is a new macro MAIN_VISIBLE which tells
		how many items in the main list to actually show.

nano-0.8.2 - 02/02/2000
- Added initial mouse (-m, --mouse) support.  New global variable
  use_mouse. (Adam Rogoyski)

- nano.c:	Set intial value of fill to COLS - 8 rather than just 72
		regardless. (Adam Rogoyski).
  do_delete():	
		Deleted call to do_backspace() when on the end of a line,
		because it won't update the line properly.
  do_backspace():
		Removed unnecessary pointer manipulation that was being
		handled by unlink_node().
  open_file():
		Added check for trying to open a directory (currently we
		segfault on this).  Bug pointed out by Chad Ziccardi.

nano-0.8.1 - 01/28/2000
- Implemented Pico's -r (fill) mode, command line flag -r or --fill.  New
  global variable fill, affects check_wrap(), do_wrap(), main(), usage(),
  global.c and proto.h.
- nano.c:
write_file():		Added (incredibly) necessary check for EPERM when
			link() fails.  This allows us to actually save
			files via rename() on filesystems that dont
			support hard links (AIEEEEEE).
do_goto():
			Fixed a stupid mistake where we were calling
			bottombars() with replace_list instead of goto_list.
- nano.h:
			New char *help in shortcut structure for help
			feature. Added NANO_*_MSG and NANO_*_HELP #deifnes
			for help function and i18n.
- global.c:
			New functions shortcut_init (called in nano.c) and
			sc_init_one() to initialize the shortcuts without
			using {}s (for i18n).

nano-0.8.0 - 01/25/2000
- View flag (-v, --view) implemented.  Global variable view_mode, affects
  main loop of nano.c and new_file(). (me)
- nano.c:
			split checks for TERMIOS_H and TERMIO_H up so we
			can (theoretically) include them both, which is good.
handle_sigwinch():
			Added check for ncurses.h.  (Andy Kahn)
do_spell():
			We now only try ispell because we don't as of yet
			handle the 'spell' program the right way, now that
			I finally know what the right way is =-).  Added
			call to edit_update(fileage) to stop segfaults.
global_init():
			Added initialization of edit* filestruct pointers
			to stop segfaults on spell check.
usage():
			Check for getopt_long, and if no leave out the
			GNU options everyone seems to love so much (Andy Kahn)
main():
			Added checks for getopt_long (Andy Kahn)
			We ignore character 126 because it gets put into
			the buffer when we page up/down on a vt terminal.
write_file():
			Fixes for umask (Adam Rogoyski).  Renamed tmpfile
			variable to tmp.  Documented the tmp opttion
			better in the function comments.  Fixed my 
			stupidly commented out check for tmp on setting
			umask which I really like =>
- nano.h:
			Made desc variable in shortcut struct a pointer
			instead of a fixed-length string.
- utils.c:
			Fixed check for config.h before nano.h.
- configure.in:
			New checks for getopt_long, getopt.h, removed
			CFLAGS and LDFLAGS changes.  Gonna have to run
			strip manually now =-) (Andy Kahn)
			Added check for HAVE_WRESIZE, new file acconfig.h (me).

nano-0.7.9 - 01/24/2000
- New autoindent feature.  Command flag 'i' or '--autoindent'.  New
  function do_char() to clean up character output, global
  variable autoindent in global.c. (Graham Mainwaring)
- New flag 't' or '--tempfile', like Pico's -t mode, automatically saves
  files on exit without prompting.  Affects do_writeout().  Also
  do_writeout() now takes a parameter for if exiting.
  Global variable temp_opt in global.c (Graham Mainwaring)
- Preliminary spell program support.  Added command flag '-s' or
  '--speller' for alternative speller command.  Added function do_spell()
  and exit_spell() to nano.c.  New global variable alt_speller.
- nano.c:
  main():	We now ignore input of decimal 410 because these get entered 
		when we resize the screen.  Sorted options in getopt()
		switch statement.
  usage():	Sorted options and changed tabs to make room for -s option.
  write_file():	Now takes a second parameter 'tmpfile', uses mask 0600 and
		doesn't print the number of lines written on the statusbar.
  global_init():
		Added more initializations to globals to support do_spell().

nano-0.7.8 - 01/23/2000
- Stubbed justify function.  Affects main() in nano.c and nano.h defines.
- Added Fkey equivalents for Pico compatibilty.  Affects nano.h defines
  and main() in nano.c
- Removed redundant reset_cursor() calls from the blank() routines.
- nano.c:
  main():	Fixed typo in main while loop for NANO_ALT_REPLACE_KEY.
		Removed check for isprint() characters in main while loop
		for people with odd character sets *shrug*.  Added some X
		window F-key combos.
  read_line():	New function, consolidates of most of the special
		sections of the file reading code. (Rob Siemborski)
  do_replace(): Many scattered fixes. (Rob Siemborski)
  write_file():	Added check for empty filename.
- winio.c:
  nanogetstr():	Fixes for deleting at places other than the end of the
		buffer, cut support. (Adam Rogoyski)
  blank_edit():	New function, blanks edit buffer.  Added call to it in 
		total_refresh().
- configure:	Checks for glib if snprintf of vsnprintf aren't available
		(Andy Kahn). Changed warning message when no termcap lib
		is found.

nano-0.7.7 - 01/19/2000
- Option '-v' for version moved to '-V', because -v is Pico's "read only"
  mode (affects getopt() in main() and usage() function in nano.c
- New flag -c, always show cursor position.  Affects main() in nano.c and
  statusbar() in winio.c
- Option '-x' doesn't show help window at the bottom of the editor.
  New variable no_help in nano.h and proto.h, affects main(), usage(),
  and global_init() in nano.c, blank_bottombars(), clear_bottomwin(),
  bottombars(), and do_yesno()  in winio.c  (I had to apply this patch by
  hand =P) (Adam Rogoyski)
- nano.c:
  handle_sigwinch():	New function (Adam Rogoyski), handles resizing.
  page_up(), page_down():	
	- New functions.  We now set the cursor at the top right corner,
	  not at the center line, and page up and down a full screen
	  rather than a half screen. Original functions renamed to
	  page_up_center() and page_down_center().
  main(): 
	- Added check for keystroke key sequence 407 or NANO_CONTROL_Z
	  in main while loop because suspend mode was broken.  This should
	  fix it, at least for now.
	- Added long option support (By popular harassment ;-) - Added
	  #include for getopt.h, changed getopt() to getopt_long().
	  Options added so far: --version (-V), --nowrap (-w), --suspend
	  (-z), --help (-h), --nohelp (-x).
	- Rewrote signal statements (Adam Rogoyski)

nano 0.7.6 - 01/15/2000
- New ChangeLog format
- nano.c: 
  main(): 	Bound CONTROL_H to backspace (oops)
		Added more Alt-[-key combinations, for page up & down.
  read_bytes():	New function (Adam Rogoyski)
  read_file():	Optimizations - malloc()s *buf a little at a time rather
		than one huge buffer, and replaced the strcat at the end
		with an index variable.  Added call to read_bytes().
  do_next_word(): New function, binding is control-space (0) (me)

- winio.c: 
  bottombars():	Fixed non-expanding shortcut keys at bottom of screen.
		(formula is extra space needed = COLS / 6 - 13).
  actual_x() & strlenpt():	
		Added bug#9 fix - when tabs % 8 == 0, we should only
		increment tabs by 1.
  titlebar():	Fixed overrun in titlebar on very long filenames.

0.7.5	Pico 'last line' feature added (Rob Siemborski & me).  Eliminated
	writing a newline at EOF. do_cursorpos and do_replace are now not
	directly bound to signals but picked up as their control sequences
	in raw mode. Bug fix in do_backspace. Fixed bug #9 (woohoo!)
0.7.4	Optimized (obfuscated?) edit_refresh. Malloc() calls checked for
	available memory, align bug fixed (Big Gaute).

--- As of version 0.7.4 TIP is renamed to nano.

0.7.3	Fixed a double blank_statusbar() when jumping to first and last
	lines.  Took out unnecessary updates in load_file. Bug fix in
	do_left. Missing updates to totlines, fixed bug #7 (last line not
	having a newline at the end doesnt get read, bugfix in do_replace
	with replace all, more/better comments (Robert Siemborski)
0.7.2	Our first patch accepted into the source! configure fixes 
	and optimizations (Erik Anderson).  Added missing stdarg.h to winio.c. 
	Bug fix in update_line for editing long lines. Fixed arguments
	being put into the filename when none is specified. Preliminary
	+line command argument function.
0.7.1	configure tweak for better FreeBSD support. Removed refresh() from
	edit_refresh to stop cursor "jumping" during screen updates.  This
	will probably cause a bug or two. Replace is now Alt-R (@R) and 
	Goto line is Alt-G (@G), but they have control key aliases of ^\ and 
	^_ respectively.  Made Control-F,B,N,P work like they do in Pico.
	Control-G will become the Help key, but for now is stubbed out.
0.7.0	Fixed missing stdlib.h from cut.c. Fixed a few message bugs in
	findnextstr. Bound Control-D to Delete. Refixed segfault on zero
	length file. Added Esc-[-A,B,C,D cursor key sequences.
0.6.9	Preliminary cursor position function. Split up tip.c more, made
	new files cut.c and winio.c. Fixed a bug in cut_marked_segment
	that was leaving out a character.
0.6.8	By request, optchr in main() is now an int.  Removed unneeded
	globals. Bound functions for next/prev page, and wrote functions
	do_home and do_end.
0.6.7	Bugfix in do_uncut_text for totlines. Broke up open_file and
	created read_file.  Implemented Insert File. Fixes in tipgetstr
	for erroneous keystrokes. Added leave_cursor arg to do_yesno().
0.6.6	Fixes in do_search(), do_replace(), do_writeout, and do_exit() for 
	aborted searches and more Pico-compatible messages. statusq() now
	returns -2 on a blank entry instead of -1. Bug fix in actual_x().
0.6.5	More BSD compatibility.  Fixed two bugs in do_uncut_text
	regarding buffers with filebot in them.  Fixins in do_backspace
	and do_enter. Removed unused variables. Removed strip_newline.
0.6.4	Took out the awful newlines from each string buffers.  This will
	certainly cause more bugs. Fixes in do_exit(). Better empty file
	handling (I hope).
0.6.3	Implemented ^E.  Removed now unneeded wrapline from filestruct.
	do_enter() rewritten.
0.6.2	Better default file permissions. Complete rewrite of do_wrap().
	Better handling of editing with cursor near COLS - 1.
0.6.1	Starting to implement wrapping toggle. Fix for unhandled control
	codes being entered into the buffer. Bug fix in actual_x; more
	> COLS - 1 functionality, especially on lines with TABs.  Fixed being 
	locked into cutbuffer when cutting more than one marked screen of text.
0.6.0	We have TABs!!!  To do this, placewewant is now set to the actual
	width on the screen we want to be, not an index of current->data.
	New functions xplustabs and actual_x convert the actual place
	the cursor should be on the screen to and from the place in the
	string.
0.5.5	Changed do_right to test do_down before setting current_x to 0,
	eliminiating the "looping" on the last line when holding the right
	arrow.  Preliminary support for longer than COLS - 1 lines.
	Wrote do_delete.
0.5.4	Fixed a big in total_update that wasn't repainting the screen properly.
	tipgetstr is much more messy but text is now more editable ;)
	Fixed crash on entering a new file, hopefully. Awful stub for tab
	handling, only in do_right() to save me some sanity.
0.5.3	Added check for malloc.h.  Implementing uncut from marker slowly.
	Fixed a few bugs in do_uncut when not uncutting from marked text.
        I would not trust your data with the mark code right now, but then
        we're not at version 1.0 yet so dont trust anything ;)
0.5.2	Added reset_cursor() before end of update_line so cursor doesnt
	jump after each keystroke entered. Select text stubbed. Fixed
	a bug in total_refresh().  Setting a mark will hilight properly,
	but does not actually affect what gets put in the cutbuffer (yet).
0.5.1	Writing a file out causes modified to be set back to 0.  Good.
	Set_modified function written.  Cut and uncut text now set
	modified when called.
0.5.0	Half way there!  Implemented write out, save function seems
	stable.  Changed statusbar blank routing to not refresh, a separte
	program calls it and then refreshes.  Made the program not clear
	the srceen on exit, just the bottom two lines (like Pico).
0.4.2	Implemented replace all in replace function.  Crude exit function
	(asks yes or no if modified but does not write to file).
0.4.1	Implementing search & replace.  Fixed crash on deleting at top of
	edit buffer.  Implemented "timeout" of statusbar messages.
	Implemented ^A and ^E (beginning and end of line).
0.4.0	Split code into global.c and proto.h to allow for better multiple
	file handling.  Added #defines for the majority of the shortcut
	kets in tip.h for easy modification. 
0.3.1	Write edit_refresh which doesn't move the screen around, just
	updates what's there already.  do_wrap() and do_enter() added.
0.3.0	Preliminary cutbuffer (cut and uncut) support.
0.2.7   Check for Modification added.  do_search() works.
0.2.5	Rewrite of file data struct.
0.2	Read in data to buffer, bound keystrokes to stub functions, 
	initial cursor movement on screen.  Initial autoconf support.
0.1	Initial program setup w/ncurses
