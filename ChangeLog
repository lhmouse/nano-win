CVS Code -
- General:
	- Translation updates (see po/ChangeLog for details).
	- Upgraded to gettext 0.11.2 (Jordi).
	  Removed intl/ entirely, and a few more tweaks by gettextize.
	- i18nized a few strings used in DEBUG mode. (DLR)
	- Some chars being assigned 0 are now assigned '\0'. (DLR)
	- Put header file #includes in a more consistent order. (DLR)
	- Remove some unneeded blank lines and spaces, and make some
	  spacing more consistent. (DLR)
	- When possible, use iscntrl() to determine whether a character
	  is a control character or not. (DLR)
	- Miscellaneous typo fixes. (DLR)
	- Many fixes to the help browser and shortcut lists: efficiency
	  updates, consistency fixes, help text fixes and improvements,
	  and spacing improvements. (David Benbennick)
	- Make more functions use const variables when possible. (David
	  Benbennick)
	- Add Carl Drinkwater's backup file option (-B or --backup on the
	  command line, M-B in nano's global shortcuts). If the original
	  file is unchanged from when it was loaded, it is backed up to
	  filename~; if the original file has been changed or deleted
	  since it was originally loaded, it isn't backed up.  The backup
	  file retains the permissions, owner/group, and
	  access/modification times of the original file.  This option is
	  disabled when --enable-tiny is used.  It will not back up
	  temporary files.  Minor fixes to it by David Benbennick and
	  DLR.  Changes to open_file(), add_open_file(),
	  load_open_file(), write_file(), and do_writeout().
	- Add \n's to the ends of "filename is %s" debugging strings.
	  (Carl Drinkwater)
	- Add the long option --quotestr as an alternative for -Q, and
	  --regexp as an alternative for -R; they were listed in nano's
	  usage information, but weren't actually in nano.  Also, display
	  "-?" as an alternative for "-h" in nano's usage information,
	  put the command line options in a more consistent (i. e. mostly
	  alphabetical) order in nano, put the long options in a more
	  consistent order in rcfile.c and nanorc.sample, don't include
	  rcfile options if their equivalent command line options are
	  disabled, and remove obsolete relative option from
	  nanorc.sample. (DLR)
	- Change "File Name to Append/Prepend" to "File Name to
	  Append/Prepend to".  The original prompt could confusingly
	  imply that we are appending/prepending another file to the
	  current file, when we are actually appending/prepending the
	  current file to another file. (DLR)
	- Put nano.1, nano.1.html, and nano.texi up to date. (DLR)
	- Typo fixes for the ChangeLog. (David Benbennick)
- files.c:
  read_file(), read_line():
	- Rework to properly handle nulls in the input file, fix
	  detection of binary files to properly mark a file as binary if
	  the only binary characters it contains are ASCII 127's, and
	  after reading the last line of a file that doesn't end in a
	  newline, increment totsize.  Remove previous kludge to set
	  totsize properly. (DLR)
  write_file():
	- Rework to properly handle nulls in the input file.  When
	  appending/prepending, don't change the current file's name to
	  the name of the file it's being appended/prepended to.  When
	  writing a marked selection to a file, save and restore totsize
	  so it isn't decreased by the size of the selection afterward.
	  (DLR)
  do_writeout():
	- Fix problem with formatstr's being defined as NULL when
	  --enable-tiny is used.  Since formatstr isn't ever used in tiny
	  mode, don't bother even creating the variable. (David
	  Benbennick and DLR)
  append_slash_if_dir(), input_tab():
	- Changed a variable name: lastWasTab -> lastwastab. (DLR)
- global.c:
  free_toggles():
	- Only include if we're not using tiny mode. (David Benbennick)
  toggle_init():
	- Remove global entries for search toggles, as they aren't really
	  global. (DLR)
	- Don't reinititialize the toggles if they've already been
	  initialized; it's unnecessary and even causes a segfault in
	  do_toggle() if Pico emulation mode is the toggle in question.
	  Don't free the toggles here, either; it's unnecessary after the
	  above change. (David Benbennick)
  shortcut_init():
	- Rework IFHELP macro (David Benbennick).
- move.c:
  page_down(), page_up():
	- Put sanity checks for current_x back in, to avoid rare
	  segfaults (oops). Now, however, they are only called when
	  placewewant is zero instead of being called unconditionally;
	  see changes to winio.c:actual_x_from_start() below. (DLR)
- nanorc.sample:
	- Put in much less crappy example regex rules for c-file.
- nano.c:
  clear_filename():
	- Remove this function, as it has unneeded functionality, is
	  short enough to be inlined, and is only called in two spots
	  anyway. (DLR)
  do_int_spell(), do_alt_spell():
	- Rework to save the marked selection before doing spell checking
	  and restore it afterward. (DLR)
  do_toggle():
	- Since the search mode toggles aren't global anymore, we don't
	  need to explicitly block them here anymore (which will end up
	  blocking the global backup mode toggle, which is the same as
	  the backwards search toggle). (DLR)
  main():
	- Rework to blank out filename manually before doing anything
	  with it, instead of calling clear_filename() in two places.
	  Make startline an int instead of a long, since it's supposed to
	  hold a line number. (DLR)
	- Properly handle multiple -r settings on the command line. (Carl
	  Drinkwater)
- rcfile.c:
  colortoint():
	- Only include if ENABLE_COLOR is defined. (DLR)
- search.c:
  search_init():
	- Since the search mode toggles aren't global anymore, rework the
	  part of this function referencing them so that they still work.
	  (DLR)
	- Remove unneeded toggles variable. (David Benbennick)
  findnextstr():
	- Update the current line at current_x if we don't find a match.
	  Also, pass current_x_find to strstrwrapper() so we know whether
	  we're at the beginning of a string or not (see changes to
	  strstrwrapper() below), and reset it between lines. (DLR)
  do_gotoline():
	- Make sure placewewant is zero after we go to a line. (David
	  Benbennick)
  do_gotopos():
	- Simplify the sanity check to only put x within the range of the
	  current line; don't call actual_x() anymore. (DLR)
- utils.c:
	- Add sunder() and unsunder().  These functions convert nulls
	  other than the terminating null in strings to newlines and
	  back; they're used to handle null characters in files properly.
	  (DLR)
  strstrwrapper(): Set REG_NOTBOL when we're not at the beginning of a
	  string, to avoid false positives when searching for regular
	  expressions prefixed with ^. Make it take a new parameter,
	  line_pos, to determine where we are in the string. (DLR)
- winio.c:
  actual_x_from_start():
	- Overhaul to make cursor placement more like that of Pico: add
	  sanity check for i, and then place i as close to the value of
	  xplus column as possible.  This change is most noticeable when
	  moving down through binary files. (DLR)
  nanogetstr():
	- After the user presses Enter at the prompt, refresh the edit
	  window in case there's a list of possible filename matches
	  (left over from attempted tab completion) on it. (DLR)
  titlebar():
	- Tweak text spacing and printing so that the titlebar text looks
	  better on smaller terminals. (Carl Drinkwater)
  update_line():
	- When marking control characters, make sure the mark moves
	  forward by two characters instead of one.  Rework control
	  character display routine to display newlines within the line
	  (which should never occur under normal circumstances; they will
	  only be there if the line had nulls in it and was unsunder()ed
	  beforehand) as ^@'s. (DLR)
  do_help():
	- Add support for the handled keyboard escape sequences in the
	  help menu, as they are needed with some terminals (e.g. xterm
	  with TERM=ansi). (DLR)
- configure.ac: Added ms to ALL_LINGUAS (Jordi).
- THANKS:
	- Completed a bit (Jordi).
	- Fixed David Benbennick's email address (David Benbennick).

- General:
	- Typos n misspellings all over the place (David Benbennick).
	- Allow --tiny and --multibuffer to cooperate (who the heck
	  would want this is beyond me but ;-).  Changes to 
	  configure.ac, global.c, ,  (David Benbennick).
	- Change to openfilestruct for multibuffer mode by DLR.
	  New functions nano.c:make_new_opennode(), free_openfilestruct(), 
	  delete_opennode(), unlink_opennode(), splice_opennode(),  
	  new struct openfilestruct in nano.h. 
	- Preliminary prepend code.  This may be a bad idea, but I've
	  been wanting it for awhile now and we'll see how bad it messes
	  everything up.  Changes to files.c:do_writeout(), write_file().
	  Fixes for O_CREAT & append compatibility by David Benbennick.
	- Change from read() and write() to file streams by Jay Carlson.
	  Allows OS to implement read and write ahead rather than making
	  us do it.  Hopefully merged properly.
	- More cleanups with DISABLE flags, better free_shortcutage and
	  free_toggle, and get rid of unnecessary variable decls with 
	  NANO_SMALL in shortcut_init() by David Benbennick.
	- Added "syntax" command to .nanorc file, to allow multiple 
	  syntaxes.  New function color.c:update_color(), calls in various
	  files.c places, syntaxtype struct, global variables syntaxes,
	  syntaxfile_regexp and synfilematches.  Global flag -Y ,--syntax
	  to specify the type on the command line, if there's no good 
	  filename regex to use.  Global variable syntaxstr.
	- Changed many strcmp()s and strcpy()s to their equivalent
	  '\0' counterparts (David Lawrence Ramsey).
	- Many changes to allow marked cutting to work with multiple
	  file buffers: changes to openfilestruct type in nano.h and
	  files.c (David Lawrence Ramsey).
	- Changed NANO_SMALL to ENABLE_NLS for gettext disabling 
	  (David Benbennick).

	  #s to their character equivalent.
  main()
	- Changed charalloc(), strcpy()s to mallocstrcpy()s.
- nano.h:
	- NANO_ALT_COMMAND and NANO_ALT_PERIOD were reversed (lol)
	  (David Benbennick).
- nano.spec.in:
	- Don't put Chris' name as the Packager in the distribution
	  by default (Im an idiot).
	- Fixed Source line (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- nano.1:
	- Changed references to Debian GNU/Linux to Debian GNU (Jordi).
- nano.1.html:
	- Updated for -Y option (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- rcfile.c:
	- Made some rc file errors less fatal.
	- Added in my patch for getpwent instead of relying on $HOME
	  (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- winio.c:
  edit_add()
	- Changed some syntax highlight computations for the sake of COLS.
	- Add in the necessary regfree() calls to stop nano from leaking
	  memory like a sieve when using color syntax highlighting :-)

	  various fixes and changes by Chris, Rocco and David Benbennick. 
	  New function nano.c:open_pipe() and signal handler cancel_fork(), 
	  changes to do_insertfile(), new list extcmd_list, cmd is 
	  ^X after ^R.
	- Added separate regex variable (color_regex and colormatches)
	  so that color syntax and regex search/replace can coexist.
	- Added new nano.spec file from Brett <brett@bad-sports.com>, 
	  added because maintaining the spec file is getting to be a large

  do_rcfile()
	- Reset lineno between system and local .nanorc file.

GNU nano 1.1.7 - 03/05/2002
- General
	- malloc->calloc, etc cleanups (DLR).
	- New option, noconvert (-N, --noconvert) to completely stop
	  the translation of files from DOS or Mac format (DLR).
	- New functions check_writable_directory() and safe_tempnam()
	  to get around the tempnam warning. More improvements (DLR)  
	  Still needs testing.
	- Added DOS and Mac format options to write file routine.
	  Changes to shortcut_init() and do_writeout().	
	- Removed stupid static definitions of toggles and shortcut
	  lists.  Many changes to shortcut_init(), toggle_init(),
	  statusq(), nanogetstr(), main(), and many other places.
	- Multibuffer mode now allows multiple empty filenames.  
	  Changes to add_open_files(), removed open_file_dup_search(),
	  open_file_dup_fix(), etc (DLR).
	- New code to handle multiple .save files.  Changes to 
	  die_save_file(), new function files.c:get_next_filename()
	  and utils.c:num_of_digits(). (Dwayne Rightler, DLR & Chris)
	- Many malloc() cleanups and files.c tweaks by Steven Kneizys,
	  new functions utils.c:free_shortcutage() (got to love that
	  name!) & free_toggles(), and big cleanup program 
	  thanks_for_all_the_fish() (originally 
	  thanks_for_the_memories()).  Mods to shortcut_init() by Chris.
	- Preliminary quoting support for justify.  New arg -Q, --quotestr,
	  changes to do_justify(), global variable quotestr().
- Makefile.am:
	- Add SYSCONFDIR to DEFS, so we can have an /etc/nanorc.
	- Change localedir line to 1.0's version.
	- Moved m4/ stuff to its own m4/Makefile.am.

	  file), set NO_CONVERT if found (fixes by DLR).
 do_insertfile()
	- Added support for -o in prompt (Steven Kneizys).
- global.c:
	- Move openprev and opennext functions to shortcuts, they really
	  aren't toggles (DLR).

	- Allow " symbol to be in regex without leading \ by checking
	  for *ptr+1 is not the end of the regex.

	  (quoting wise) than the beginning of the justification.
  help_init()
	- Added message re: having multiple blank buffers (DLR).
  main()
	- Add 407 as equiv of 26, this seems to be sent when using

	  systems.
  strstrwrapper()
	- NANO_SMALL test was backwards (Ken Tyler).
- winio.c:
  strlenpt()

nano-1.1.6 - 01/25/2002
- General
	- Add Meta-A as alternate keystroke for ^^ for people with
	  non-US keyboards.
	- Add Alt-G (NANO_ALT_GOTO_KEY) as alternate for goto dir in 
	  browser.
	- Better partial word checking code. New function 
	  search.c:is_whole_word(), changes to findnextstr(), 
	  and nano.c:do_int_spell_fix() (Rocco Corsi).
	- Added multiple-line regex support.  Format in .nanorc is
	  start="regex" end="regex".  Cleaned up nanorc:parse_colors(),
	  added parse_next_regex(), changes to edit_add in winio.c(), 
	  changes to colortype, cleaning up some old cruft. 
	- Upgrade to gettext 0.10.40, probably broke everything again :)
	- Upgraded to and then downgraded from automake 1.5, as there 
	  are severe security implications.
- color.c:
  do_colorinit()
	- Moved some comments and braces around so color can work 
	  w/slang (DLR).
- global.c:
  shorcut_init()
	- Replace hard coded ALT_G and ALT_H values in the replace
	  and goto shortcuts with their macro counterparts NANO_ALT_*_KEY.	
- nano.c:
  usage()
  	- Remove extra \n in --keypad description (Jordi).
  main()
	- Check that alt value is an alpha char before comparing to 
	  val - 32, fixes Alt-R calling doprev instead of replace.
  do_char()
	- Run edit_refresh() if ENABLE_COLOR is defined so adding
	  multi-liners will update (e.g. /* in C).
  do_int_spell_fix()
	- Temporarily unset REVERSE_SEARCH if it's set (Rocco Corsi).
  do_suspend()
	- Call tcsetattr() to restore the old terminal settings, so
	  tcsh can use ^C after suspend for example (fixes BUG #68).
  do_wrap()
	- Move "right" increment to part where new line is created, 
	  should change (fix?) some wrapping problems with autoindent.
  version()
  	- Show --enable-multibuffer independently of --enable-extra being
	  compiled in (Jordi).
- nano.h:
	- Changed color struct slightly, because of previous issue with
	  applying color painting in order, the "str" portion was 
	  useless.  Renamed "val" in colortype to "start", added "end"
	  for multi-line color strings.
- rcfile.c:
  General
	- Took silly variables being passed everywhere like lineno and
	  filename and made them static variables.
	- Re-indented.
	- Added stdarg.h to includes.
  rcfile_error()
	- Now automatically prepends the "error in line blah at foo"
	  message to error messages.
  parse_colors()
	- Added section for computing "end" section.
  parse_next_word()
	- Added support for "\ ", in word parsing.
- search.c:
  do_search()
	- Check position of cursor and return value of findnextstr and
	  tell user if search string only occurs once (Rocco & Chris).
  findnextstr()
	- Fix off by one in check for wrap around (Rocco Corsi).
- winio.c:
  edit_refresh()
	- Rename lines to nlines to fix AIX breakage (reported by
	  Dennis Cranston, re-reported by arh14@cornell.edu).
  edit_add()
	- Refuse to honor regex matches of 0 characters when applying
	  color highlighting, and say so on the statusbar.  Otherwise
	  we go into an infinite loop, the error message should clue
	  users into the fact that their regex is doing something bad.
- THANKS:

nano-1.1.5 - 01/05/2002
- General
	- Better integration of View mode (-v) and multibuffer.
	  Fixes to new_file(), do_insertfile_void(), shortcut_init()
	  (David Lawrence Ramsey).
	- The keypad handling has changed (again).  We now use 
	  the keypad() function by default.  New flag -K, --keypad
	  allows the old behavior for those using the keypad arrow keys
	  and rxvt-based terminals.
	- Updated copyright notices to 2002 (Jordi).
- nano.c:
  die()
	- Only save files that were modified (David Lawrence Ramsey).
  do_cont()
	- Run signal_init() after doupdate() so ^Y wont suddenly
	  start suspending after returning from ^Z suspend in Hurd.
  signal_init()
	- Unconditionally disable VDSUSP if it exists, stops ^Y
	  suspending nano on the Hurd.
  help_init()
	- Typo fixes in help strings (Jordi).
	- New variable helplen needed cause currslen is not always
	  the length we want (bug found by David Lawrence Ramsey).
	- Typo in file switch string (found by David Lawrence Ramsey).
  main()
	- Handle Alt prev/next file keys (,.), as well as normal ones (<>).
	- Handle OS-specific insert keys by jump to do_insertkey (David
	  Lawrence Ramsey).
- files.c:
  read_file()
	- Make conversion message less confusing (suggested by Jordi).
- rcfile.c:
  parse_next_word()
	- Get rid of ptr == \n check to abort, screws up option
	  parsing (bug found by David Lawrence Ramsey)
- winio.c:
  update_line()
	- set realdata check to >= 1 && <= 31, lack of > 0 check screwed
	  high ascii characters.
  titlebar()

nano-1.1.4 - 12/11/2001
- General
	- Preliminary syntax highlighting support.  New functions
	  colortoint() and parse_color() in rcfile.c, new code in 
	  edit_add() in winio.c to actually do the highlighting.  It's
	  not even close to pretty yet :P
	- Many int/long alignments (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- files.c:
	- Fixes for tab completion and screen refresh (David Lawrence
	  Ramsey).
  add_open_file()
	- Get rid of unsetting MARK_ISSET because otherwise writing
	  marked text will automatically unset the marker with
	  multibuffer enabled.
- global.c:
	- Define currshortcut and currslen when either DISABLE_MOUSE
	  or DISABLE_HELP or DISABLE_BROWSER is not defined (Silvan
	  Minghetti).
- nano.c:
  main()
	- Add Esc-[-[IGL] keys for FreeBSD Console (PgUp,PgDn,Insert).
        - Added better Hurd support for function keys (Alt-V,U,9,@,F).
  signal_init()
        - do SIG_IGN for the SIGTSTP sigaction regardless of whether
          we have _POSIX_VDISABLE or not (more Hurd fixes)
  help_init()
	- Typo fixes and additions to the new help texts.
  do_curpos()
	- Now takes arg for constant updating to always show the cursor
	  position (David Lawrence Ramsey).
  do_wrap()
	- Many fixes (David Lawrence Ramsey).
  do_spell() 
	- Dont prompt for replace if we don't change the word in
	  question (Rocco Corsi).
- po/de.po:
	- German translation updates (Karl Eichwalder).
- po/ru.po:
	- Russian translation updates (Sergey A. Ribalchenko).
- po/sv.po:
	- Swedish translation updates (Christian Rose).

	- Danish translation updates (Keld Simonse).
- po/es.po:
	- Spanish translation updates (Jordi).
- po/fr.po:
	- French translation updates (Michel Robitaille).
- m4/gettext.m4:
	- diff against mutt 1.2.5's gettext.m4.

nano-1.1.3 - 10/26/2001
- General
	- Finally wrote function-specific help mode.  Changes to
	  nano.c:help_init() and winio.c:do_help().  Changed
	  currshortcut and currslen #ifdefs to depend on both 
	  DISABLE_HELP and DISABLE_MOUSE being defined to not 
	  include.  Changed all the shortcuts and lengths.
	- Fixed null_at to ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING with its arg.  Again,
	  this was causing nasty errors if the call to nrealloc moved
	  where the data was located.
	- Changed header comments to say "version 2" instead of "version
	  1" as the COPYING file is actually version 2 of the GPL (bug
	  noticed by Jordi Mallach).
- cut.c:
  do_cut_text()
	-  Check to see whether marked text is contained within edit
	   window and if so only do an edit_refresh (variable dontupdate
	   replaces cuttingpartialline).
  do_uncut_text()
	- Similar display fixes (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- faq.html
	- Removed nano-editor.org FTP site address [deprecated] and added
	the GNU one.
- files.c:
	- Added status messages for converted DOS and Mac files.
	  People should know that their file wasnt normally formatted.	
  load_file()
	- Status message when trying to load an already loaded file with multiple
	  buffers (David Lawrence Ramsey).
  read_file()
	- Get rid of useless linetemp variable and name num_lines int
	  (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- nano.c:
	- New function do_prev_word, similar to do_next_word.  Hard coded as
	  Alt-space, as next word is hard coded as control-space. Fixed
	  goofy logic setting x pos to value of last line when hitting the
	  beginning of first line, prog should simply abort.  Added
	  the #ifdefs around the code in main().
- nano.h:
	- Additional #define, SMALL_TOO to determine how long
	  MAIN_LIST_LEN is.  We need this because of the find matching
	  bracket code.
  main()
	- Moved #ifndef NANO_SMALL down past the case 0: line so
	  control-space doesn't insert a \0 (ack!)
- rcfile.c:
	- Fix incorrect number of rc options (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- po/sv.po:
	- Updated Swedish translation (Christian Rose).
- po/da.po:
	- Updated Danish translation (Keld Simonsen).
- po/es.po:
	- Style updates to Spanish translation (Santiago Vila).
- po/ru.po, po/uk.po:
	- Updated Russian and Ukrainian translation (Sergey A. Ribalchenko).

nano-1.1.2 - 10/03/2001
- General
	- Added BUGS #63 & 64.  Fixes in search_init() and nanogetstr(),
	  new flag CLEAR_BACKUPSTRING because there's no easy way to
	  clear the backupstring without making it global (messy), so we
	  use a flag instead (just as messy?)
	- --enable-tiny now leaves out the Auto Indent code, do you really
	  need that on a bootdisk? =-)
	- New flag -o, --operatingdir, similar to Pico's -o mode.  New
	  function check_operating_dir(), changes to load_file (arg),
	  open_file_dup_search (arg), new function do_gotopos for -F
	  (David Lawrence Ramsey).
	- Code to read/write dos formatted files.  Massive amounts of
	  new code in read_line and write_file.  New cmdline flag
	  (-D --dos) to automatically write the file in DOS format,
	  regardless of the original format.
	- Mac file writing supported too.  Flag -M, --mac.  Toggle 
	  Meta-O (MacOS? OS-X? =-)
	- New smooth scroll code by Ken Tyler.  New flag -S, --smooth,
	  changes to page_up() and page_down().  Many fixes to paging by
	  David Lawrence Ramsey.
	- Bracket (brace, parens, etc) matching code by Ken Tyler.  
	  New functions do_find_bracket(), changes to findnextstr(),
	  command is Meta-] (hope you dont mind since I already sold off
	  Meta-O to the MacOS file code Ken...) Fixes to bracket_msg
	  by DLR.
	- Call do_gotopos from do_alt_spell() to keep position
	  consistent when invoking alt speller (DLR).
	- Readded DISABLE_CURPOS because in certain instances (like
	  all the "Search Wrapped" lines) the cursor position will
	  be different yet we don't want the cursor position displayed.
	- Take control-space out of -tiny build, unneeded.
- cut.c:
  cut_marked_segment()
	- Add magic line when cutting a selection including filebot
	  (discovered by DLR, fixed by DLR & Chris, fixes BUG #66).
  do_cut_text()
	- Don't recenter the line when cutting one line (DLR) (Bug #65).
- faq.html:
	- Notes about the Free Translation Project.
	- Debian additions.
- files.c:
  do_writeout()
	- Expanded strings to not use %s and ?: to determine
	  write/append string to be nice to translators.
  new_file()
	- Initialize totsize (DLR).
- nano.c:
  main()
	- Added var constcheck as a CRC-like check of whether cursor
	  pos has changed and if so update the pos with -c.
	- Many tweaks and changes from numerics to char equivs
	  (David Lawrence Ramsey).
	- Fix the KEY_IC being undefined when using slang.
  do_mouse()
	- Send 27 when the menu item clicked is an alt key seq... The
	  lines aren't lined up since the menu width changed though,
	  this breakage depends on whether the new widths will be kept
	  or not (FEEDBACK!!)
	- Change k based on currslen to allow the new widths in
	  bottombars().
  do_wrap()
	- Fixes for Pico incompatibility in cases 2b and 2c.  
	  (David Lawrence Ramsey).
  global_init()
	- New arg save_cutbuffer, allows cutbuffer to not be lost when
	  using multibuffer.
- nano.1:
	- Added new features, fixed some typos (Jordi).
- nano.texi:
	- Corrected the Mouse Toggle section, noticed by Daniel Bonniot.
	- Added many command line options, toggles and other additions
	  (Jordi).
- rcfile.c:
	- NUM_RCOPTS fix (DLR).
	- Add tabsize support to rc file (Nathan Heagy).
	- Fix incorrect argument in fill and tabsize error message
	  (Nathan Heagy)
- search.c:
	- Changed search prompt to "Search" followed by a list of
	  bracketed, free-standing modifiers that do not imply a grammar,
	  and the (to replace) string separately.  Hopefully this resolves
	  the i18n problems that this provoked.
  findnextstr()
	- Various fixes that need testing (Ken Tyler).
- winio.c:
	- Add David Lawrence Ramsey to credits.
  bottombars()
	- Spread out the menu items, feedback definitely needed on this.
  nanogetstr()
	- More key fixes (David Lawrence Ramsey)
	- Don't be clever and wasteful, just repaint every iteration.
- po/nl.po:
	- New Dutch translation, by Guus Sliepen <guus@nl.linux.org>.
- po/ca.po, po/es.po:
	- Updated Catalan and Spanish translation (Jordi).
- po/gl.po:
	- Updated Galician translation (Jacobo Tarrío).
- po/da.po:
	- New Danish translation, by Keld Simonsen <keld@dkuug.dk>.
- po/sv.po:
	- Updated Swedish translation (Christian Rose).
- po/it.po:
	- Updated Italian translation (Marco Colombo).
- po/fi.po:
	- Updated Finnish translation (Pauli Virtanen).

nano-1.1.1 - 07/28/2001
- General
	- Reverted included gettext from 0.10.38 to 0.10.35 in intl/ dir.
	- Added m4/ directory to allow rebuilding using only the internal
	  version of gettext.m4 (Albert Chin).
- nano.c:
  main()
	- Change the multibuffer getopt option to 'F' (David Lawrence
	  Ramsey)
  do_mark()
	- Temporarily disable cursorpos when enabled to be able to see
	  the mark (un)set message (Ken Tyler).
- nanorc.sample
	- Typo fixes and updates (David Lawrence Ramsey)
- files.c:
  new_file()
	- Do add_open_files if there aren't any open yet (David Lawrence 
	  Ramsey).
  close_open_file()
	- Try to open the next file first, then the previous one 
	  (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- global.c:
  shortcut_init()
	- Rewrote the whereis and replace lists to put CANCEL at the end
	  of the list, and not include the toggle functions when using
	  NANO_SMALL.
- nano.h:
	- Fix type in INSERTFILE_LIST_LEN.
	- Rewrote all the macro definitions to be a little less messy,
	  for the #ifdefs anyway.
- rcfile.c:
	- Update for the multibuffer option (oops) (David Lawrence Ramsey).
- search.c:
	- Added #ifdef NANO_SMALLs around the REVERSE_SEARCH code.
  search_init()
	- add #ifdef NANO_SMALL around toggles code.
- winio.c:
  bottombars()
	- Fixed an off by one that wasn't letting lines with odd #
	  shortcuts work in certain cases.

nano-1.1.0 - 07/15/2001
- General
	- New global variables currshortcut and currslen to support using
	  the mouse with the shortcuts.  Also supports clicking on files
	  in browser.  Added #ifdef DISABLE_MOUSE around this code also.
	- Changed mouse disabling code from depending on --enable-tiny
	  to its own flag, --disable-mouse.  The --tiny option defines
	  this automatically, but now just mouse support can be disabled
	  if desired.
	- File Browser supports the "Goto Directory"
	- Added rcfile.c source file.  Only includes much of anything when
	  --enable-nanorc is used.  Tons of new funcs, most notably
	  do_rcfile() called from nano.c:main().  Added much needed 
	  function ncalloc(), will have to go through source code later 
	  and change the appropriate calls which used nmalloc for lack of
	  an appropriate calloc function *** FIXME ***
	- After "Alternate" spell checker is called, cursor is repositioned on
	  the same line as before ^T was pressed. 
	- Moved config.h up in all .c files #include list (Albert Chin).
	- Added config.guess and config.sub to distribution because,
	  apparently, newer autoconf/automakes can't live without them.
	- Various spelling updates by David Lawrence Ramsey.
	- Changed all string allocations to charalloc(), new function
	  designed to take nmalloc argument but call calloc based on 
	  (char *) size.
	- New macro DISABLE_WRAPJUSTIFY to easily check for both wrapping
	  and justify being disabled.  This allows us to compile out the 
	  -r flag if neither are set, and will also allow us to comment
	  out -W when it is written.
	- Allow fill to take a negative value to signify a "from right side"
	  value.  This allows the value to vary with the screen size yet
	  still be correct.  New static value wrap_at to minimize code
	  impact.  Updated man page and info file.
	- Allow file appending.  New shortcut list nano_insertfile_list (since
	  insert and write routines can't share shortcut lists anymore), 
	  new args to do_writeout and write_file called append, and of source
	  code changes to those functions.
	- Allow backwards searching.  Drastic rewrite of the search prompt
	  string by Chris.  All other code by Ken Tyler.  New globals
	  nano_reverse_msg, new functions revstrstr and revstrcasestr,
	  many changes to search functions.  Not too big a code size
	  increase!
	- Moved extension functions (Case Sensitive, Regexp, and Backwards
	  Search, Append key in write file function) to Meta keys, as
	  people are complaining loudly about nano not being control-key
	  compatible with Pico, which is a Bag Thing (TM).  Changes to
	  shortcut_init, toggle_init, new toggles for backwards and regexp
	  (and you can now toggle all search options including regexp at
	  the Search: prompt!)  Changes to nanogetstr to enable Meta
	  keys to be grabbed, changes to onekey to print M-style shortcuts. 
	- New macro TOGGLE which just toggles, no more silly checking
	  ISSET and then using SET or UNSET when we want a simple toggle
	  for a flag.
	- Added multiple buffer capability (God help us).  New configure
	  option --enable-multibuffer (-F), changes to do_insertfile(),
	  do_insertfile_void(), toggle_init(), do_gotoline(), edit_update(),
	  and write_file(), new functions add_open_file(),
	  open_file_change_name(), load_open_file(), open_file_dup_search(), 
	  open_file_dup_fix(), open_prevfile(), open_nextfile(),
	  close_open_file(), get_full_path(), die_save_file(), etc.
	  (David Lawrence Ramsey).
	- Using --enable-extra automatically defines --enable-multibuffer
	  changes to version() and configure.in.
	- Moved to gettext 0.10.38 at the last second, sure to break 
	  something, but at least I can run make distcheck!
- Makefile.am:
	- Include ABOUT-NLS and the new THANKS files to the distributed list.
- THANKS:
	- Initial, incomplete list of people to thank.
	- Added some more people.
- configure.in:
	- New option, --enable-nanorc, which allows people to have a .nanorc
	  initialization file and set options normally used on the command
	  line, and color later on.
	- Added --enable-color option to allow color and syntax highlighting
	  (stub as of now).
- cut.c:
  add_to_cutbuffer()
	- Remove useless statements (Rocco).
  cut_marked_segment()
	- Add bizarre copy of bot node, else *BSD goes ballistic (fixes
          BUG #60).
	- Added 'destructive' argument.  Allows the selected text to be
	  added to the cutbuffer without changing the contents of the 
	  file.  This allows writing selection to separate files.
  do_cut_text()
	- If the line is empty when using -k and wasn't already added,
	  create a dummy line and add it to the cutbuffer (fixes bug #61)
	- Reset marked_cut if we blow away the cutbuffer.
	- Moved the case of current == mark_beginbuf into cut_marked
	  segment, so do_writeout could call it when writing selection to
	  file.
  do_uncut_text()
	- Reset cutbuffer even if we're uncutting marked or cut to end text!
- faq.html:
	- Brought the FAQ up to date, many little changes (Jordi).
	- Added sections 3.7 and 3.8 for the multibuffer and nanorc support.
- files.c:
  do_browser()
	- Minor fixes to the processing of SELECT function (Rocco)
	- Added the "Goto Directory" code (Rocco)
	- Don't shift the size of the file is it's less than 1K. Fixed
	  files less than 1K being displayed as 0B (Rocco).
	- More Picoish keystrokes for the browser, ^P, ^N, etc, for up,
	  down, etc, and add the consistent ^C to exit (Jim Knoble).
  do_writeout()
	- New code to allow writing selected text to a separate file.
	  When this is done, the current state is preserved.
  write_file()
	- New arg, nonamechange, means whether or not to update the
	  current filename after writing the file out.
	- Increment lineswritten when the very last line isn't null.
	  Fixes off by one count when writing selection to file.
- global.c:
	- Updated some of the lists for the "Goto Directory" code (Rocco)
- move.c:
  page_up()
	- Rewritten with a loop to make screen updates work when
	  mark is set (fixes bug #59).
  do_home(), do_end()
	- Don't keep cutbuffer.
- nano.1:
	- Added the missing -r flag (Jordi).
- nano.c:
  do_alt_speller()
	- Reposition cursor on same line as before ^T was called (Rocco)
  ABCD(), main() 
	- Add Alt-whatever-[a-d] support as well as Alt-whatever-[A-D].
  main()
	- Code to silently process "-g" and "-j" (Rocco)
	- Added Alt-[-7,8 support for home/end keys (Jeff Teunissen).
  signal_init()
	- Reorder sigaction calls, use sigfillset() to stop SIGTSTP and
	  SIGCONT from being interrupted, allows suspending nano
	  to work more reliably, esp. with mutt, etc. 
  do_suspend()
	- Don't try to play with the handler inside the handler.  Just
	  raise a SIGSTOP.  We also now write the "use "fg"" message to
	  stdout instead of stderr.
	- Added _POSIX_VDISABLE macro to fully ignore suspend keystroke.
	  Eliminates the possibility that nano can be suspended when
	  it's not supposed to be.  Many many many thanks to Jordi and
	  Tom Lear for helping out finding and fixing this bug!
  do_cont()
	- Now just does a refresh call instead of playing with the SIGTSTP
	  handler.
- nano.h:
	- Updated the BROWSER_LIST_LEN for the "Goto Directory" code (Rocco)
- proto.h:
	- New shortcut list added: gotodir_list (Rocco).
- search.c:
  do_gotoline()
	- Optimizations, remove "$" goes-to-last-line, less messages (Rocco)
  do_replace()
	- If we manage to make it in somehow with VIEW_MODE on, abort
	  nicely (fixes BUG #59).
- utils.c
  strcasestr()
	- Replaced by mutt's mutt_stristr function, because the thought
	  of dynamically allocating memory and copying each line in a file
	  to do a search or replace was causing me to lose sleep.
- winio.c:
  actual_x()
	- Remove inline from function decl (Albert Chin).
- po/POTFILES.in:
	- Added utils.c to the list.
- po/es.po, po/ca.po:
	- Updated (Jordi).
- po/gl.po:
	- Galician translation by Jacobo Tarrío.
- po/uk.po, po/ru.po:
	- New Ukrainian and Russian translations by Sergey A. Ribalchenko
	  <fisher@obu.ck.ua>, thanks!
- po/id.po:
	- Updated Indonesian translation by Tedi Heriyanto.
- po/it.po
	- Updated Italian translation by Marco Colombo.
- po/no.po:
	- New Norwegian translation by Eivind Kjørstad <ekj@vestdata.no>.
- po/sv.po:
	- New Swedish translation by Christian Rose <menthos@menthos.com>.

nano 1.1 tree forked here 04/07/2001

nano 1.0.1 - 04/06/2001
- General:
	- added configure option --disable-wrapping.  Does what it says,
	  no wrapping or checks are done.  Separate from --enable-tiny,
	  some may want a bare-bones Pico clone that does wrap text.
	  Affects configure, nano.c:do_char() and check_wrap() obviously,
	  version(), and do_char().
- aclocal.m4:
	- Minor patch for intl check (really this time) (Albert Chin)
- faq.html:
	- Fixed typo in section 6.1 (discovered by Bob Farmer).
- files.c:
	- fix two typos in comments, one in ChangeLog (Matthias Andree)
  diralphasort()
	- Stop abort on symlinks (Matthias Andree)
	- use strcasecmp to sort directory if available, pilot does that
	  as well (Matthias Andree)
  filestat(), do_browse()
	- Changed lstat calls to stat, which fixes the browser not
	  following links to directories.  We only use lstat() when
	  printing the details of the file, and if it is a link, then
	  check via lstat() for link to a directory.  If it is 
	  a directory, display (dir), else use the normal "--".
  do_browser()
	- Fix broken size suffix off-by-one errors (Matthias Andree)
  cwd_tab_completion(), do_browse_from()
	- Use PATH_MAX instead of 0 arg to getcwd (Matthias Andree).
	- Changed above to use PATH_MAX only when defined on the
	  system, as the HURD e.g. does not support it.
- intl/Makefile.in:
  distclean
  	- added intl/libintl.h to the rm -f rule, should fix the unresolved
	  gettext symbols problem (Jordi).

nano-1.0.0 - 03/22/2001
- General
	- Added void to functions declared as () args, nano.c:do_mark()
	  and search.c:regexp_cleanup(). (Christian Weisgerber).
	- Changed internal variables called "new" to "newnode" to avoid
	  the "new" C++ reserved word, even though there is likely no way
	  nano will EVER be compilable with a C++ compiler. (suggested by

nano-0.9.99pre2 - 01/31/2001
General
	- Removed center_x and center_y globals.  center_y was
	  completely unused and center_x was only used a few places,
	  easily replaced with COLS / 2 (oops, not current_x & y (Rob)).
	- Deleted free_node, duplicate of delete_node, and changed all
	  free_node calls to delete_node.
	- Fix for resizing the window in modes other than normal edit mode 
	  Changes to handle_sigwinch(), main().  Fixes bug #52 (Rocco).
- files.c:

nano 0.9.99pre1 - 01/17/2001
General
	- Changed #ifdefs to check for both DISABLE_TABCOMP and
	  NANO_SMALL, makes tiny option leave out tab completion, which
	  should be left out in that circumstance.  Saves at least 5k.
	- Previous change to #ifdefs DISABLE_TABCOMP and NANO_SMALL rolled
	  back. (Rocco)
	- Various #ifdef & #ifndef cleanups. (Rocco)
	- Added message for when keypad goes awry.  Added code in main and
	  function print_numlock_warning() to notify user, and added an
	  appropriate section in the faq to refer to this brokenness.
	- Added macros in nano.h for magic values that might be unclear in
	  nano.c:global_init(). (Rocco)
- configure.in:
	- Fix for _use_keypad check breaking slang support (Christian
	  Weisgerber).
	- Changed to automatically define the 5 DISABLE variables when
	  NANO_SMALL (enable-tiny) is requested at configure.
- faq.html:
	- Added some info on making the binary smaller with the configure
	  script.
	- Added section on keypad bugginess.
- files.c:
  real_dir_from_tilde()
	- Oops, fix case where buf ="~", silly crash (bug discovered by
	  Neil Parks).
  do_browser()
	- Added space and - keys to do page up and down.
  cwd_tab_completion(), input_tab()
	- Changed bare malloc/calloc calls to nmalloc (found by Rocco).
	- Added memset() to matchBuf to ensure sanity (Rocco, Adam).
- nano.c:
  ABCD()
	- New function, figures out what kbinput to return given
	  input common to several switch statements, allows us to 
	  support the default Konsole key settings.
  main()
	- Alternate speller option no longer valid if DISABLE_SPELLER is
	  active. (Rocco)
	- Removed direct calls to usage() (#else) for -k (cut) or -s (speller)
	  options when these have been disabled. (Rocco)
	- Initialized kbinput to get around stupid compiler warning.
  nano_small_msg()
	- This function has been removed.  All references now call
	  nano_disabled_msg. (Rocco)
  version()
	- When NANO_SMALL (enable-tiny) is defined, the 5 main DISABLE
	  variables (SPELLER, HELP, JUSTIFY, BROWSER, TABCOMP) are not
	  reported as enabled when Nano is called with -V (--version)
	  command line option. (Rocco)
  usage()
	- Alternate speller option no longer valid if DISABLE_SPELLER is
	  active. (Rocco)
  window_init(), handle_sigwinch()
	- Added check for not having enough LINES to do anything useful,
	  if so die with an error. (Rocco)
  die_too_small()
	- Function to print the window too small error message, avoids
	  repeated string defs and globals.
  do_justify()
	- Small fix for totsize calculation (Rob)

- fi.po:
	- Update by Pauli Virtanen.

nano 0.9.25 - 01/07/2001
General - 
	- New file browser code.  New functions in files.c:do_browser(),
	  helper functions browser_init(), tail(), striponedir(),
	  filestat().  New shortcut list browser_list.  Some new
	  strings to translate.  Added function do_browse_from().
	- Keypad code has been changed slightly.  Now checks for
	  _use_keypad flag in window to see whether or not to turn 
	  the keypad() back off when finished (taken from aumix).  Moved
	  to winio.c where it should probably be anyway.  New configure
	  check for _use_keypad in window struct.  This will have to do
	  for now.
	- Moved keypad() calls for PDCURSES from main() to window_init()
	  so the keypad continues to work after a Meta-X, for example.
	  Fixed bug #51.
- faq.html:
	- Fix typos and small mistakes (Jordi).
- files.c:
  username_tab_completion()
	- Added the (char *) sizeof when allocating memory for the filename
	  array (Rocco).
  cwd_tab_completion()
	- removed skipping . and .. when tabulating matches.
	- Added the (char *) sizeof when allocating memory for the filename
	  array (Rocco).
  do_writeout()
	- Now takes an argument so the string typed in can be retained
	  when calling the browser.
  do_browser()
	- Don't decrement longest by the length of path.  Fixes crashes
	  on entering various dirs  (Rocco).
	- Don't ungetch() the exit key, unneeded, fixes inserting a file
	  causes exit code.
- move.c:
  page_down()
	- Don't do an edit_update when there is only one page of text
	  (fileage == edittop && filebot == editbot).  Fixes Bug #50.
- nano.c:
  main()
	- Reorder the getopt options to be more or less alphabetical
	  (suggested by Sven Guckes).
- winio.c:
  do_cursorpos()
	- Optimizations and cleanups by Rocco Corsi.
  do_credits()
	- Spell Erik Andersen's name right.
  titlebar()
	- Now takes an arg, needed for browser function.
  do_help()
	- Changed way of temporarily bringing up shortcuts at the
	  bottom in the help screen (actually works).
- utils.c:
  mallocstrcpy()
	- Takes char pointers now instead of void (makes debugging a
	  helluva lot easier)
	- Duh, don't do anything if src == dest!
- es.po:
	- Updates for file browser (Jordi).

nano 0.9.24 - 12/18/2000
General
	- Added --disable-help option, affects acconfig.h, configure(.in),
	  winio.c:do_help, nano.c:help_init,help_text_init,version.
	- Changed filename to no longer use PATH_MAX, so it can work on the
	  HURD.  Changes in files.c:write_file(), new function
	  nano.c:clear_filename(), many changed in main(), a few other
	  places.  Please test this!
	- Added -b, -e, and -f flags, which we ignore as nano provides 
	  their functionality already.
- cut.c:
  do_uncut_text()
	- Fix renumbering bug when uncutting marked text at filebot.
	- Fix screen not being displayed when we are uncutting marked
	  text at editbot (Bug discovered by Ken Tyler).
	- Fix magic line not getting created when (you guessed it)
	  uncutting marked text at filebot (Ryan Krebs).
- files.c:
  read_file()
	- If we encounter an error and insert is not set, run new_file().
	  (bug discovered by Ben Roberts).
  write_file()
	- Change open call flags, basically copy joe's way of doing it so
	  a more recent version will actually be included in (un)stable.
	- Remove useless fstat call.
  open_file()
	- Added check for S_ISBLK and S_ISCHR, don't open device files!
- nano.c:
  renumber()
	- Don't stupidly assign the value of prev->lineno if prev == NULL!
  main()
	- Added code to check for Alt-Alt (27-27) keystrokes and set the
	  next keystroke as a control sequence.  New variable 
	  modify_control_key.  Removed #ifdef _POSIX_VDISABLE check
	  around Control-S,Q,Z handlers because we need it now for
	  the Alt-Alt-x code.
	- Added --view option to getopt_long()call .  Bug discovered 
	  by Rocco Corsi.
  help_init()
	- Fix off by one error that was making ^G help in normal mode and
	  ^_ in pico mode not be displayed in the help (bug discovered by
	  Rocco Corsi).
  do_toggle()
	- Added fix_editbot() call to fix improper redisplay of edit
	  window when using nohelp toggle (bug discovered by Rocco Corsi).
- nano.1, nano.1.html:
	- Updated man page for -b, -e, -f and expanded explanation for -p.
- winio.c
  do_help()
	- Force keypad on so F-keys and PageUp/Down will work properly.
	  Added check for NANO_EXIT_FKEY to loop.
- utils.c:
  new_magicline()
	- Increment totsize!!  We decrement it when we've read a file, 
	  everywhere else it should automatically be incremented

nano 0.9.23 - 12/08/2000
General
	- Changed --disable-spell to --disable speller.  The term is
	  "speller" for -s, so it should be --disable-speller.
- files.c:
  write_file()
	- Added tmp check to TMP_OPT section (how appropriate).
	- Added new consistency checking code from securityfocus 
	  article by Oliver Friedrichs, and use O_EXCL if tmp == 1.
	- We now run check on result of lstat(), not stat(), to be
	  safer.  New variable anyexists, we use still use realexists
	  later in the program.
	- OOPS, line up link/unlink/rename check if conditional with 
	  top if conditional.  Option -l has been broken for 9 versions,
	  no one noticed?!
	- Added saving perms at end of link so we can apply them to the
	  new file if --nofollow is used.
- winio.c:
  edit_add()
	- Off by one display error (fix by Rocco Corsi).
  do_replace_highlight()
	- New code to handle being past COLS (Rocco Corsi).
	- Moved from search.c, as it's definitely a winio function now =)
  update_line()
	- More '$' display fixes (Rocco Corsi).

nano 0.9.22 - 12/02/2000
- General
	- Username tab completion code, and cleaned up existing tabcomp
	  code. New functions real_dir_from_tide(), append_slash_if_dir(),
	  username_tab_completion is more than a stub now =-).
	- Ignore key sequence 543 & 545, right control and alt keys in
	  windows. Affects main() and winio.c:nanogetstr().
	- Took out help from spell_list and changed SPELL_LIST_LEN to 1.
	  Is using a spell checker THAT difficult? =-)
	- New function nano_disabled_msg(), to alert that certain
	  functions have been disabled, similar to nano_tiny feature.
- New configure options:
	- Added configure argument --disable-tabcomp.  Affects
	  bottom of files.c and write_file, utils.c:check_wildcard_match()
	  and winio.c:nanogetstr().
	- New options --enable-extra.  New code in nano.c:version() to 
	  print out various options from ./configure, function do_credits().
	- Added --disable-spell option for those who want to just disable
	  the spell check feature.  Affects the spelling functions
	  do_spell, do_int_speller and do_alt_speller.
	- Added --disable-justify to get rid of the justify function.
	  Affects do_justify() (not surprisingly).
- files.c:
  write_file()
	- Unsetting modified on temp files bug fixed (Rocco Corsi).
	- Okay, if tmp == 1 and the file exists, we abort.
  do_insertfile()
	- Added call to real_name_from tilde, oops.  Added check for
	  DISABLE_TABCOMP.
  read_file()
	- Added check for fileptr == NULL.
- global.c:
  shortcut_init()
	- Now takes an argument as to whether to display the unjustify
	  shortcut or the normal uncut text one.  Needed to accommodate
	  the kludgey unjustify code.
- nano.1, nano.1.html:
	- Updated date on pages because of -p changes.
	- Added "NOTES" section, where I explain what nano.save & friends
	  are.
	- Added a copyright notice for the manpage, under the GPL.
	- Other minor changes.
- nano.c:
  do_justify()
	- Wrote unjustify code.  Borrows cutbuffer and stores the unjustified 
	  text there, then grabs the next keystroke and, if the unjustify
	  key, gets rid of the justified text and calls do_uncut_text.
	  Added macro NANO_UNJUSTIFY_KEY.
  do_int_spell*
	- Various fixes (Rocco Corsi).
	- Changed abort of program to aborting based on value of "edit a
	  replacement" question, and not caring about the replace loop
	  return value.  That way the user can get out of the replace loop
	  and continue spell checking (very important to me anyway).
  version()
	- Took out huge check for the various --disabled macros,
	  eventually there will be too many to reasonably check for.  
  nano_small_msg(), nano_disabled_msg()
	- Added checks for disabled functions to see whether or not to
	  declare them.
  do_next_word()
	- Update the previous line as well as the current one in case we
	  have moved beyond COLS or back from COLS, patch submitted
	  by Ryan Krebs.
  die()
	- Now creates .save file using variable-length strings.  Also
	  calls write_file with tmp == 1, which happens to do exactly what
	  we want (abort on save file exists and use mode 0600).
  handle_sighup()
	- Now calls die instead of writing on its own and exiting normally.
- search.c:
  do_replace_highlight()
	- New function, displays the currently selected word as highlighted
	  in the spell check.  Called from do_replace_loop (Rocco Corsi).
	- Added calls to curs_set(0) and (1) to disable the cursor when
	  highlighting, looks much better.
- es.po: 
	- Traditional Spanish strings updates.

nano 0.9.21 - 11/23/2000
- AUTHORS
	- Added Rocco Corsi.
- nano.c:
  main()
	- Changed check for argc == 1 to argv[optind] == NULL to decide
	  whether or not to display "New File" in the statusbar.
- search.c:
  findnextstr()
	- Fix current_x increment bug by using another variable (Rocco Corsi).
  search_init()
	- Silly typo in our "one simple call" of statusq.  Stopped
	  previous search string from being displayed.
  do_replace()
	- Copy back the previous value of last_replace into answer if
	  using PICO_MODE and answer == ""
- winio.c:
  do_up()
	- Deleted first update_line() call, screws up display when marker is
	  set.
- nano.1, nano.1.html
	- Updated man page for new -p definition.

nano 0.9.20 - 11/18/2000
- General
	- Ran source through indent -kr again.  Make everything pretty.
	- Changed behavior of "search" and "replace" prompts to make all
  	  previous values editable.  This change was made so that you can 
	  replace with the null string without needing a special key for it.  
	  changed code in search_init(), do_replace(), nanogetstr (see
	  below).
	- Added some missing gettext calls here and there (Jordi).
	- Revamped nanogetstr() and calls to it to use variable length
	  strings.
	  MANY changes in nanogetstr(), many chances in search.c, new
	  function mallocstrcpy which is sure to be a programmatic
	  nightmare, changed last_search, last_replace, answer to
	  pointers.  New function not_found_msg in search.c for displaying
	  truncated strings in statusbar when the string is not found
	  (-pedantic fixes by Rocco Corsi). We disable this feature when
	  using PICO_MODE (-p).
	- New spelling code by Rocco Corsi.  New functions
	  do_int_speller, do_alt_speller, changes to do_spell in nano.c,
	  New functions search_init_globals and do_replace_loop, changes
	  to search_init(), do_replace, findnextstr, moved last_search and
	  last_replace back to nano.c (*shrug*).
	- New tab completion code.  Used check_wildcard_match, input_tab, 
	  cwd_tab_completion, username_tab_completion from busybox, 
	  hacked them a lot, changes to nanogetstr().  nanogetstr() and
	  statusq() now take an arg for whether or not to allow tab
	  completion.
	- Fixed value being input in statusbar during a search or replace
	  and CASE_SENSITIVE or the other search is called and the
	  string being typed in is blown away.  Reported by Ken Tyler.
	- Changed PICO_MSGS flag to PICO_MODE, changed help strings
	  accordingly.
- files.c:
  do_writeout()
	- Change strcpy to answer to mallocstrcpy.
- global.c
	- New global replace_list_2, for 2nd half of the replace dialog
	  ("Replace with:"), has fewer options than first half because
	  they were inappropriate.  
  toggle_init()
	- Added #ifdef around toggle_regex_msg to get rid of compiler 
	  warning.

- nano.c:
  keypad_on()
	- New function, toggles turning the keypad on and off in edit and
	  bottomwin().  Added call to this in finish(), fixes bug #45.
- search.c
  findnextstr()
	- New arg for begin_x variable, basically a rewrite that
	  makes a little more sense and isn't quite as messy (Rocco Corsi).
	- Update the line we're checking if not the whole screen, because
	  it's quite possible the search team could exist somewhere way
	  to the right on the same line, for example.
  replace_abort()
	- Add reset of placewewant, stops cursor from jumping when moving
	  cursor after a replace.
  do_replace()
	- Added code for Gotoline key after entering the search term.
	  Fixes bug #46.
	- Removed redundant code involving processing replacement string.
	  Converted if statements to switch statements.
	- Optimizations by Rocco Corsi.
	- Removed code for deleted shortcuts from in replace_list_2.
  do_search()
	- Converted if statements to one switch statement.
- winio.c
  nanogetstr()
	- Added check for 343 in while loop to get rid of getting "locked"
	  into statusbar" bug in odd $TERMs like iris-ansi.
	- Changed check to return -2 on "enter" from answer == ""
	  to answer == def.
	- Fixed fallthrough code because there was no break.  Make much
	  more sense now.
	- Added check for ASCII 54[124] when using PDCURSES, ignore them
	  if noticed.
  nanoget_repaint()
	- New function, removes about 30 lines of duplicate code in 
	  nanogetstr().
	- Black magic code to make $ appear in prompt if we're past
	  COLS.
  blank_edit()
	- Removed wrefresh() call, much less choppy now.  If there's a need
	  for a wrefresh after a specific call, let me know.
- es.po:
	- Updated translation for 0.9.20 (Jordi).
  
nano 0.9.19 - 10/02/2000
- General
	- Added PDCurses support under cygwin, which allows building
	  a nice stand-alone nano.exe for those poor Windows users.
	  Extra check in configure.in for initscr() in -lcurses (as
	  PDcurses has no tgetent), some #ifdef PDCURSES statements
	  in main().
	- Changed web site and email to new nano-editor.org domain.
- nano.c
	- Added (int) casts to remove compile warnings with -Wall.
  main()
	- Added check for _POSIX_VDISABLE around term variable definition.
- search.c
	- Added initializations for last_search and last_replace (Rocco Corsi)

nano 0.9.18 - 09/18/2000
- General
	- Changed _POSIX_VERSION checks in regex code to HAVE_REGEX_H, 
	  added check for regex.h in configure.in.
- configure.in:
	- Added default case for cross-compiling to get rid of annoying
	  AC_TRY_RUN warning.
- cut.c:
  do_cut_text()
	- Don't immediately abort if we're on filebot and the marker is
	  set (fixes bug #42).
- files.c:
  open_file()
	- Fix for bug #44 (Rocco Corsi).
- global.c:
  shortcut_init()
	- Added in FKEYs that for some reason were left out.  *boggle*
- nano.c:
  main()
	- Added check for _POSIX_VDISABLE and use raw mode if not
	  available, allows nano to work with cygwin.
	- Added gettext calls to enable/disable strings (Jordi).
	- Revamped a great deal of the F-key and keypad key handling,
	  because we not longer use keypad() (see below).
	- Removed keypad() call because nano was not working with the
	  keypad in many terms, which is very bad.
	- Made insert key call do_insertfile().
  do_toggle()
	- Rewrote function to allow NOHELP toggle to work on systems
	  without a working resizewin().  New function window_init().
  mouse_init()
	- Add keypad only if mouse support is on, otherwise mouse doesn't
	  work.  I guess you have to choose between having the mouse and
	  having a working keypad for the time being (thank god for Meta-M).
- winio.c:
  total_refresh()
	- Added titlebar() call.
  onekey()
	- Off by one error fix fix ;-) (Rocco Corsi).

- search.c:
  findnextstr()
	- Reset starting at current for search instead of begin.
- es.po:
	- Translated new strings and minor updates (Jordi).
- de.po 
	- Revised translations by floki@bigfoot.com

nano-0.9.17 - 09/04/2000
- General
	- New shortcuts to toggle certain options that are normally only
	  flags via Alt/Meta.  See Alt-C,E,I,K,M,P,X,Z.  New struct called
	  toggles in nano.h, toggle_init(), toggle_init_one() in global.c
	  called from shortcut_init(), and do_toggle in nano.c.  Also 
	  moved the signal code into a separate function in nano.c called
	  signal_init().  Moved "struct sigaction act"into a static in
	  nano.c.
	- Changed from Alt-key symbol (@) which is completely nonstandard
	  to the *nix "Meta" symbol (M-).  Changed help_init to show
	  the M-key usage and the help text to explain keys which generate
	  Meta.  Moved the toggle Meta keystrokes to the first column
	  instead of the third as they are the primary keystrokes for the
	  functions.  Thanks Mini editor team :->
	- Changed last_search and last_replace vars to statically 
	  allocated (hence nulled) and moved to search.c (Matt Kraai).
- global.c:
  toggle_init()
	- Changed "No auto wrap" and "No help mode" to "Auto wrap" and 
	  "Help mode". See the change to do_toggle() below.
- nano.c:
  do_mouse()
	- Patch for handling lines w/tabs and mouse better (Ben Roberts).
  do_wrap()
	- Made wrapping code less ambitious.
  do_toggle()
	- Added checks for no help and no wrap mode, and print opposite
	  enable/disable message.
  do_suspend(), do_cont():
	- New functions, handle suspend signal in a Pico-like manner and
	  work with Meta-Z.
- winio.c:
  total_refresh()
	- Added edit_refresh() call to actually update the screen if messy.
  edit_refresh_clearok()
	- New function, does a total update for edit refresh, needed to fix
	  lack of reversed text on searching with MARK_ISSET.
  onekey()
	- Off by one error fix (Rocco Corsi).

  update_line()
	- Added check for binary data >= 1 and <= 26, and use ^+letter
	  to display it.   Should fix editing text files with binary
	  data in them.  Placing of the cursor seems to be a bit screwed
	  though...
- search.c:
  search_abort()
	- Now calls edit_refresh_clearok when MARK_ISSET to handle screen
	  ugliness bug (reported by Ken Tyler).
  findnextstr():
	- Added reset for placewewant (Ben Roberts).
	- Fixed check for string that only occurs on the same line failing
	  (discovered by Ken Tyler).

nano-0.9.16 - 08/09/2000
- cut.c:
  do_cut_text()
	- Fixed getting locked into cutbuffer on cutting first line of file.
	- Added check_statblank().
	- Check for fileptr == filebot, if so return, we shouldn't bother
	  cutting the magic line.
  do_uncut_text()
	- Added check_statblank().
- nano.c:
  main()
	- Changed tabsize long arg to actually accept an argument *sigh*.
- po/Makefile.in.in:
	- Patch to handle $DESTDIR (orig by Dan Harnett contributed by
	  Christian Weisgerber)
- configure.in:
	- New (and severally revised =) slang test code (Albert Chin-A-Young)

nano-0.9.15 - 08/03/2000
- Changed edit_update call to take arguments TOP, CENTER or BOTTOM.
  Affects many many functions.  Removed functions edit_update_top and
  edit_update_bot.
- Added global variable tabsize, we no longer screw with the curses
  library in order to implement -T (suggested by Christian Weisgerber).
- configure.in:
	- Finally fixed check for slang to report "no" if not called
	  with --with-slang or --without-slang
- nano.c:
  splice_node()
	- New function, abstracts linking in nodes.   Fixes bug #36.
  null_at()
	- New function, nulls a string at a given index and realigns it.
  delete_buffer()
	- Removed, same as free_filestruct().
  do_backspace()
	- Now calls page_up_center instead of page_up (as it should?)
  do_enter()
	- Fixed typo (?) in check for inptr->next.  Caused lots of
	  grief for editing lines at filebot.
  main()
	- Removed now useless usertabsize variable (Christian Weisgerber).
- search.c:
  replace_abort()
	- redundant, now just calls search abort until it does something
	  different.  
- winio.c:
  edit_refresh()
	- Added check for current line "running" off the screen.
	  Hopefully this will not cause any recursive lockups.
	  (Who am I kidding, of course it will!)
	- Added check to stop infinite loop calling edit_update.
  edit_update()
	- Rewritten, hopefully this will remove a lot of the
	  scrolling the cursor back and forth needlessly.
- move.c:
  page_down()
	- do an edit_update() at last case.  Made function more like
	  Pico's version, only move down to two lines before editbot.
  page_up()
	- Made function more like Pico's version, only move down to two
	  lines after edittop.

nano-0.9.14 - 07/27/2000
- nano.h:
	- Set CUT_TO_END to a different bit than TEMP_OPT.  Fixes bug #32.
- cut.c:
  do_cut_text()
	- Added check for MARK_ISSET when using CUT_TO_END.  Fixes bug #31.
	- Simplified check for freeing cutbuffer.  Added checks for doing
	  multiple cuts with -k, now sets marked_cut to 2 for later
	  processing by do_uncut_text().
  do_uncut_text()
	- Added handler for uncutting with -k cuts.
- files.c:
  write_file()
	- Removed (redundant) check for writing out files with -t.
  do_writeout()
	- Changed check for filename to filename[0].  Added some code, 
	  overall fixes bug #30 =-)
- nano.c:
  do_justify() & do_wrap():
	- totsize-related fixes (Rob)
- de.po 
	- Revised translations by floki@bigfoot.com

nano-0.9.13 - 07/23/2000
- Implemented Pico's -k mode.  New flag CUT_TO_END, option (-k, --cut), 
  affects do_cut_text in cut.c.  Not available with SMALL_NANO because it
  depends on the marker code which is not available with that setting.
- Changed static temp_opt to flag TEMP_OPT.  Fixed bug #29 (using
  -t with an unwritable file causes users to get locked into editor).
- move.c
  page_down()
	- Don't edit_refresh() if the bottom of the file is in the edit
	  buffer. (Adam)
- nano.c:
  main():
	- TABSIZE now set before first call to edit_refresh (Bill Soudan)
	- Different ^C kill code (patch by Christian Weisgerber).
  die():
	- More intelligent emergency-save filename selection (Rob)
  do_spell():
	- Changed exit semantics a bit so that aspell wouldn't get
	  all screwy (bug discovered by Joshua Jensen.
- files.c:
  read_file():
	- Added init of buf variable, hopefully this will stop the 
	  "bleeding" of text seen with mutt and using i18n.
  write_file():
	- Added code to check to see if using -l and the file is not
	  in fact a link.  This should fix the behavior where a file
	  that does not have write permission but could be removed and
	  rewritten is saved without error.  Please test this feature
	  and give feedback.
- search.c:
  search_init():
	- Added " (to replace)" statement to end of search string if 
	  we are doing a replace.  Manually converted all the translations
	  from '%s' to '%s%s' to ensure they still work with the new code.
	  Also put in the translation for " (replace)" in the .po's.  Hope
	  I didn't step on your toes doing this Jordi. (Chris)
  do_search(), do_replace():
	- Removed call to search_abort()/replace_abort() before call to
	  the opposite function.
	- Fixed bug #28.
  findnextstr()
	- do not center string found if it is currently visible. (Adam)
- fr.po:
	- French update by Clement Laforet <clem_laf@wanadoo.fr>.
- es.po:
	- Updated strings to 0.9.13 (Jordi).

- all:
	- New regexp search feature by Bill Soudan.  New flags USE_REGEXP
	  and REGEXP_COMPILED, new functions regexp_init, regexp_cleanup
	  replace_line, replace_regexp in search.c, changes to
	  search_init() and do_replace() and strstrwrapper(). 
	- Added _POSIX_VERSION check to regexp code.  Better than nothing
	  for non-POSIX systems...
	- Made search functions & keys more like Pico.  Added goto line from  
	  search and replace function, changed wording to "No Replace" instead
	  of "To Search", "To Replace" to simply "Replace", and changed to
	  Pico's keystroke by default, ^R. Affects search_init(),
	  do_search() in search.c, globals in nano.h and
	  shortcut_init() in global.c.
	- changed 'sprintf' calls to safer 'snprintf' (Rob)
- cut.c
	- further totsize update corrections
- files.c:
	- changed do_insertfile to call fix_editbot (Rob)
	- Magic Line code in read_file (Rob)
- nano.c:
	- Removed dual alt_speller variables, oops! (Rocco Corsi)
	- Removed unnecessary do_oldspell function (Rocco Corsi).  Added
	  SMALL_NANO #ifdef around actual spell function.
	- Moved page_up() to move.c where is belongs.
	- Corrected FIXME in do_enter with explanation. (Rob)
	- Fixed FIXME in do_justify, resulted in creation of
	  fix_editbot [also fixed in do_enter] (winio.c) (Rob)
  help_init():
	- Moved newline out of if statement (Rocco Corsi)
  do_char():
	- Magic Line related code in do_char (Rob)

  do_yesno(), nanogetstr():
	- Removed now unnecessary raw/cbreak combos.
	- Removed gettext calls from "Y(es)", "N(o)", "A(ll)" and "^C", till
	  we decide if those keybindings should be translated. (Jordi)
  clear_bottomwin():
	- Removed wrefresh(edit) call.
  edit_update_top():
	- Fixed a bug that caused nano to not update when
	  current->next == NULL (e.g. paging down to the very bottom of 
	  ABOUT NLS wouldn't work).
  fix_editbot:
	- Added (should rebuild editbot from a valid edittop) (Rob)
  edit_add:
	- removal of redundant call to mvwaddnstr

nano-0.9.11 - 06/20/2000
- New flag "-T" or "--tabsize" to specify how to display tab widths.
  Affects main() in nano.c, strlenpt(), xpt() and actual_x() (et al) in 
  winio.c, and nano.h.  Many hardcoded "8"s have been changed to the 
  TABSIZE int.  Added changes to nano.1 and nano.1.html.
- id.po:
	- Indonesian translation by Tedi Heriyanto.
- es.po:
	- Updated translation (Jordi Mallach).
- winio.c
	- Rewrite of display functions to correct the display problems 
	  we had been seeing. Affects: add_marked_sameline, edit_add,
	  and many others. (Rob Siemborski)
	- totsize fixes (Rob Siemborski)
  total_refresh():
	- Cut display_main_list call, as this function is only supposed to
	  refresh what's already on the screen, not go through the process
	  of adding the text again.
- cut.c:
	- totsize fixes (Rob Siemborski)
- nano.c:
	- experimental do_wrap and check_wrap (Adam Rogoyski)
	- Removed editwineob, as it was redundant for (editwinrows - 1).
	  Changed all calls to editwinrows - 1 in nano.c and move.c.
	- Removed all functions that were split into other files.
	  Affects LOTS of funcs.
  do_enter():
	- Added reset of placewewant to end.
  do_insertfile():
	- Fix display problem when using ctrl-r to load a file
	  into the buffer (Rob Siemborski)
  handle_sigwinch():
	- Added titlebar(), edit_refresh() and display_main_list() calls
	  because a resize wasn't picking up on possible different width
	  correctly.
- utils.c:
	- Moved nmalloc() and nrealloc() here.
- move.c:
	- New file, contains movement functions (like do_home(), do_up(),
	  do_down(), page_up(), etc...).
- files.c:
	- Contains functions for files (read_file, insert_file,
	  do_writeout(), etc).
- search.c:
	- Contains all our searching and related functions, (do_search(),
	  findnextstr(), do_replace(), do_gotoline()).

nano-0.9.10 - 06/04/2000
- es.po:
	- Translation updates (Jordi).
- AUTHORS, nano.1.html, TODO, README:
	- Documentation and email address updates (Jordi).
- nano.c:
  main():
	- Moved Adam's termio code down to after getopt() and before initscr()
	  to stop people losing their SIGINT character when using args that
	  exit nano before it runs (--version, --help, etc).

nano-0.9.9 - 05/31/2000
- Makefile.am:
	- Added proper lines for defining LOCALEDIR.
- configure.in:
	- Spelling fixes (Jordi Mallach)
	- Removed CFLAGS changes for gcc, reduces portability according to
	  some, and it certainly doesn't seem to decrease exe size.
- es.po:
	- Spanish translation updates (Jordi Mallach)
- POTFILES.in:
	- Added global.c file, was screwing up translations (i.e. they
	  weren't getting done).
- cut.c:
  add_to_cutbuffer():
	- Added totsize increment.
	- Cut fixes and optimizations (Rob Siemborski).
  do_uncut_text():
	- Added totsize increment in several places.
- nano.c:
  headers:
	- Removed LOCALEDIR define.
  do_justify():
	- Added edit_refresh() call (bug discovered by Adam).
  page_down_center():
	- Added call to edit_update(current) for last case.  Removed 
	  increment of current_y since it's now just wasteful.
  do_enter():
	- Added totsize increment.
  renumber(), renumber_all():
	- Removed totsize-- and totsize init in renumber_all.
  do_mouse():
	- Added edit_refresh() call to show highlight updates.  Removed
	  unnecessary wrefresh(edit).
  main():
	- Moved up locale calls so that translated --help messages would
	  actually get translated.
  do_backspace(), do_delete():
	- Added decrement of totsize.
  init_help_msg():
	- New function, initializes help text if NANO_SMALL isn't set (fixes
	  broken i18n).
  read_file():
	- malloc call changed to nmalloc (Rob Siemborski).
- winio.c:
  total_refresh():
	- Completely rewrote function, not quite so brain-damaged now.

nano-0.9.8 - 05/18/2000
- nano.c:
  main():
	- Added awesome code that disables the CINTR and CQUIT 
	  character (Adam Rogoyski).  Removed raw()/noraw() calls so that
	  nano gets input in 'normal' mode, which is the Right Way(tm) to
	  do it. ^S, ^Z and ^Q now work properly as a result, as well as
	  ^C.  New variable term, global variable oldterm to save previous
	  term settings, and changes to finish() and die().
	- Added extra #ifdefs in getopt code, so that above code and
	  flag init is run even if GETOPT_LONG is not #defined.
	- Added memset line before sigactions. (Adam Rogoyski)
  do_suspend():
	  Removed function, see above for why.
- winio.c:
  update_line(), center_cursor():
	- Removed wrefresh(edit) from bottom of functions.  wrefresh
	  should now only be called once, at the bottom of the main()
	  loop.
- global.c:
   shortcut_init():
	- Removed suspend sc_init call and suspend message because suspend
	  is no longer needed in the shortcut list to work properly.
    
nano-0.9.7 - 05/14/2000
- nano.c:
  do_home(), do_end(): 
	- Added calls to update_line for the current line, fixes
	  lack of update (bug discovered by Alberto García).
  main():
	- Added SET(FOLLOW_SYMLINKS) before getopt call, fixes not 
	  following symlinks even when -l isn't set, and "no changes"
	  error when nano is called from crontab -e (Adam Rogoyski).
- cut.c:
  do_cut_text():
	- Added edit_update_top to cut when mark is set, fixes lack of
	  display update (bug discovered by Ken Tyler).

nano-0.9.6 - 05/08/2000
- New Italian translation (it.po), by Daniele Medri.
- nano.c:
  page_up(), page_down():
	- Added reset of placewewant to 0, as it should be.
  do_up(), do_down():
	- Added call to update_line() for line we move from and line we
	  move to, in order to keep the highlighting correct.
  do_wrap():
	- Added var chop, new code to wrap lines more like Pico, mostly.
	  THIS STILL DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN!
- winio.c:
  do_help():
	- Added edit_refresh() before exit.
  update_cursor():
	- Removed cursor updating which really wasn't needed anyway.
  edit_update():
	- Removed yucky code that didn't work, this function now just
	  computes edittop and editbot and calls edit_refresh() to do the
	  rest, which removes a lot of duplicate code..  
  
nano-0.9.5 - 05/01/2000
- Removed bytes from file struct because it was computationally wasteful.
- cut.c:
  do_uncut_text():
	- Added call to edit_refresh().
- nano.c:
  do_backspace():
	- Added reset of editbot when deleting the last line of the file
	  (bug discovered by Adam).
  do_char():
	- Removed call to reset_cursor().
  do_delete():
	- Added similar check as to do_backspace().
  do_enter():
	- Added call to edit_refresh().
  do_left(), right():
	- Added call to update_line(), still redundant but better...
  do_up(), do_down():
	- Added refresh calls both for current line and line to which
	  we are moving.
  main():
	- Removed inefficient call to edit_refresh() after every keystroke.
	  It is now up each function to leave the screen in a good state.
- winio.c:
  do_cursorpos()
	- Rewritten to not use bytes from filestruct by an incremental sum.
  update_line(), reset_cursor():
	- Optimized calls to xplustabs() through a single variable.
	- update_line() now takes a new arg, an index into the string
	  for where to update the line from.  Needed for new update
	  code.
- configure.in:
	- Better checks for slang, allows argument to --with-slang.
	  (Albert Chin-A-Young)
	- Removed -Iintl from CFLAGS in gcc check.
- Makefile.am:
	- Addition of -Iintl for gettext (Albert Chin-A-Young)

nano-0.9.4 - 04/25/2000
 - Fixed calls to no_help and changed them to the more consistent
   ISSET(NO_HELP).  Fixed return val of no_help to be what it should (2,
   not 1.  Code to temporarily disable NO_HELP when in the
   help system. (Adam Rogoyski)
- cut.c:
  do_marked_cut(), do_cut(), do_uncut():
	- Commented out unnecessary bits when NANO_SMALL is being used.
- winio.c:
  xpt(), strlenpt(), actual_x():
	- Added check for value of data[i] & 0x80, if so do not make
	  character 2 chars wide (orig. by Chris, 0x80 check by Adam).
  edit_refresh():
	- New check for temp == NULL (bad thing), if so go back to the
	  previous line.  New filestruct var hold points to prev line.
	  Fixes segfault when paging down to the end of a file.
- nano.c:
  write_file():
	- Added check for if file exists and is not equal to the current
	  filename, prompt for overwrite (Adam Rogoyski).
  do_down():
	- Removed check for current->next == NULL, now checks return value
	  of do_down before setting current_x = 0 (discovered by Adam).
  do_justify():
	- Fixed segfault when reaching the last line (tried to assign
	  current->next->data when current->next == NULL) (discovered
	  by Adam).
- utils.c:
	- Removed extra macro defs that are now in nano.h.
- nano.h:
	- Changed macro SET() to use |= instead of ^=.  Fixes bug in
	  cut code when cutting more than one line, and cutbuffer gets
	  blown away when it shouldn't.  

nano-0.9.3 - 04/29/2000
- cut.c:
  do_marked_cut():
	- Fixed off by one error in cut code for marked text.
  do_cut_text():
	- Removed check for being on the last line, part of
	  magic line code.
  add_to_cutbuffer():
	- Moved tmp->prev = inptr line to part where cutbuffer != NULL.
	- Added inptr->prev = NULL for case where cutbuffer == NULL.
- nano.c:
  do_backspace(), do_char():  
	- Removed "magic line" code.  It was basically causing more bugs
	  than it was helping for the sake of compatibility.  This fixes
	  at least one known segfault condition.
  do_enter():
	- Added setting editbot to new node if the new node is the last
	  node in the file.
  write_file():
	- Changed writing file behavior.  Now, if last line of the file
	  has any data on it, we write a newline on it, else we don't.
- winio.c:
  add_marked_sameline():
	- New code that checks for whether the begin and end of the marker
	  are on different lines.  Missing previously.
  edit_add():
	- added some more checks for text length.  Cleaned up some
	  mvwaddnstrs that could be written more simply as waddnstrs.
  edit_refresh():
	- Removed check for temp == filebot, it is now treated like any other
	  line.  Fixes a bug where selected text on the last line shows
	  normally.
  xpt():
	- Removed an extra computation for tabs variable that was incorrect.
  xplustabs():
	- Since xpt now actually works, this func is now just a wrapper for
	  xpt(current, current_x)
- nano.1, nano.1.html:
	- Added -l option to man pages.
- configure.in:
	- New option --enable-tiny, #defines NANO_SMALL in config.h.  
	  Disables call to gettext in functions and other i18n stuff in 
	  nano.c, the detailed help mode, the resize functions, and the 
	  justify code which no one ever uses.
	- New option --with-slang.  Enables slang libraries instead of
	  ncurses, requires slcurses.h for wrapper functions. (Based
	  on patches for 0.8.7 by Glenn McGrath).

nano-0.9.2 - 04/15/2000
- This release just fixes the serious segfault problem if nano is 
  invoked any way other than using the absolute path.  The bug was
  in the new code for checking whether nano is invoked as pico.

nano-0.9.1 - 04/14/2000
- Added pico compatibility for ^T when in search or switch to switch
  to the opposite function.  Added one to REPLACE_LIST_LEN and 
  WHEREIS_LIST_LEN in nano.h, new args to sc_init_one in global.c and
  new strings that will have to be gettext()ed.  New argument 'replacing'
  to search_init().  Handlers in do_replace and do_search().
- New write code, now follows symbolic links instead of replacing them
  with the new file.  New option (-l, --nofollow) to enable the old
  (incorrect, but secure) behavior (Adam Rogoyski).
- nano.c:
  do_wrap():	
	- Fixed another bug relating to wrapping, and which would cause
	  a segfault *sigh*.
  do_replace(): 
	- Incremented current_x by the length of the replacement
	  text inside the main replace loop.  Fixes bug #15.
  add_marked_sameline():
	- New function, handles marked text when start & end of marker is
	  on one line, also supports most marked text when cursor > COLS.
  main():
	- Code to check if nano is invoked as 'pico', and if so
	  automatically set pico_msgs (Robert Jones).

nano-0.9.0 - 04/07/2000
- nano.1, nano.1.html: 	Updated man page with my email address and homepage.
- winio.c:
  reset_cursor(), update_line():	
	- Changed update algorithm for x value to (COLS - 7) multiple when x
	  value > (COLS - 2).
- edit_refresh():
	- Removed inner loop code, now calls update_line() for each line
	  in question, MUCH nicer.
- xplustabs(), xpt():
	- Removed redundant increment of tabs when column no % 8 == 0.
	- Added check for data[i] < 32, most of such bits are 2 chars wide.
- update_line():
	- Fixed a stupid call to strlenpt with col when we should have
	  been using actual_col.  Ugh.

nano-0.8.9 - 03/22/2000
- nano.c:
  empty_line(), no_spaces(), justify_format(), do_justify():
		Actually added these (screwup applying patch).
  do_justify():	Added call to set_modified().

nano-0.8.8 - 03/12/2000
- Preliminary internationalization support.  Many many functions modified
  to use gettext (via _() macro).  es.po file included. (Jordi Mallach)
  New dirs po/ and intl/, changes to configure.in and Automake.am to
  support i18n.
- nano.c:
  includes:	Added sys/param.h and limits.h. (Adam Rogoyski).
  statics: 	Changed some things that were not necessarily static 
		(Adam Rogoyski).
  nrealloc():	New function, similar to nmalloc().  Changed calls from
		realloc() to nrealloc (Adam Rogoyski).
  empty_line(), no_spaces(), justify_format(), do_justify():
		New functions for justify function (Adam Rogoyski).
- winio.c:
  blank_edit():	Added wrefresh call to edit so that screen updates (like
		on ^L) actually work.
  xplustabs(), xpt(), strlenpt(): Fixed off-by-one buglets (Adam Rogoyski).

nano-0.8.7 - 03/01/2000
- main.c:
  do_wrap():	Better fix for segfaults, and fix for lines being wrapped 
		to a single character on one line when no good place to 
		break the line exists, and for wrapping lines longer than
		COLS.
- nano.1.html:
		Html version of man page, now included in dist.  For
		the benefit of nano packages in Linux distributions.

nano-0.8.6 - 02/24/2000
- global.c:
  shortcut_init():
		Added shortcuts for goto_line and do_replace when using
		pico_msgs.  Oops.
- nano.c:
  statics:	Changed fill back to 0 from 71 by default (Adam Rogoyski).
  do_wrap():	Added check for backing up past tabs, which we shouldn't do.
		Removed check for backing up past spaces first.
  main():	Added for loop to check for alt keys instead of hard list.
  do_enter():	Fix for bug #14, added call to reset_cursor and messed
		up do_char quite a bit.
  version():	Added time and date stamp for compile on version message.
		Added mail and web page info.
- README:	Updated mailing list info.

nano-0.8.5 - 02/18/2000
- nano.c:
  main():	Finally fixed tilde being input on page up/down keys in
		certain terminal types.  Fix was input 26->91->5[34] check
		for 126, if so make the kbinput PAGE UP/DOWN, else unget
		the keystroke and continue.  Added #include <ioctl.h> for
		ioctl call.
  handle_hup():
		Handler for hangup signal.  Belated include of patch from
		Tim Sherwood.
- winio.c:
  edit_refresh():
		Temporary fix for selecting text when temp == current.
		edit_refresh() is now unmanageably complex, and must be
		revamped.
  check_statblank():
		Added check for constupdate, makes things less choppy
		(Adam Rogoyski)

nano-0.8.4 - 02/11/2000
- Moved global variables that were only (or mostly) used in one file into
  its proper file as a static.  Affects cut.c, nano.c, global.c (Andy Kahn).
- global.c:	
  shortcut_init():
		Removed redundant NANO_CONTROL_H from backspace shortcut,
		added char 127 which should have been there.
- nano.c:
  main():	Fix for loops looping until MAIN_LEN, added -1 to stop
		segfaults (Adam Rogoyski).
- Makefile.am:	Added all source filenames (Adam Rogoyski).
- nano.1:	Fixed mail addressed and added mailing list address.
- README:	Updated my email address and the nano web page.

nano-0.8.3 - 02/08/2000
- New pico mode (-p, --pico), toggles (more) compatibility with the
  Pico messages displayed in the shortcut list.  Note that there are still
  small differences in this mode.
- nano.h:	New shortcut struct format, for the benefit of i18n and
		our help menu.  Removed shortcut message macros, they are
		now all in shortcut_init in global.c.
- nano.c:
  do_wrap():	Removed resetting of current_x when we are in fact
		wrapping to the next line, fixes a bug in -i mode.
  do_enter():
		Rewrote the autoindent mode code to be a lot less pretty,
		but a lot more magical.
  main():
		Removed case for ignoring char 126 (~).  That's kind of
		important, we'll have to fix handling that sequence when
		paging up/down on a terminal some other way... Revamped
		main switch loop in much snazzier fashion based on the
		shortcut list.
- winio.c:
		New function display_main_list.  Affects all functions
		that used to call bottombars() with main_list.  Added
		because we now only call bottombars with the macro
		MAIN_VISIBLE instead of MAIN_LIST_LEN, because of the
		changes to the main_list shortcut list (see global.c below).
		New function do_help, our preliminary dynamic help system.
- Many many funcs:
		Changed from int to void to allow one uniform type to call
		from the shortcut struct.  Also a few functions that do
		not simple have void argument have new functions called
		funcname_void(void) to be called from the shortcut list.
		do_cut_text and do_uncut_text were changed to void
		arguments because they were never called with a filestruct
		other than *current anyway.
- global.c:
		Shortcut list main_list was expanded to cover all
		shortcuts that could be caught in the main loop.
		Consequently there is a new macro MAIN_VISIBLE which tells
		how many items in the main list to actually show.

nano-0.8.2 - 02/02/2000
- Added initial mouse (-m, --mouse) support.  New global variable
  use_mouse. (Adam Rogoyski)

- nano.c:	Set initial value of fill to COLS - 8 rather than just 72
		regardless. (Adam Rogoyski).
  do_delete():	
		Deleted call to do_backspace() when on the end of a line,
		because it won't update the line properly.
  do_backspace():
		Removed unnecessary pointer manipulation that was being
		handled by unlink_node().
  open_file():
		Added check for trying to open a directory (currently we
		segfault on this).  Bug pointed out by Chad Ziccardi.

nano-0.8.1 - 01/28/2000
- Implemented Pico's -r (fill) mode, command line flag -r or --fill.  New
  global variable fill, affects check_wrap(), do_wrap(), main(), usage(),
  global.c and proto.h.
- nano.c:
write_file():		Added (incredibly) necessary check for EPERM when
			link() fails.  This allows us to actually save
			files via rename() on filesystems that dont
			support hard links (AIEEEEEE).
do_goto():
			Fixed a stupid mistake where we were calling
			bottombars() with replace_list instead of goto_list.
- nano.h:
			New char *help in shortcut structure for help
			feature. Added NANO_*_MSG and NANO_*_HELP #defines
			for help function and i18n.
- global.c:
			New functions shortcut_init (called in nano.c) and
			sc_init_one() to initialize the shortcuts without
			using {}s (for i18n).

nano-0.8.0 - 01/25/2000
- View flag (-v, --view) implemented.  Global variable view_mode, affects
  main loop of nano.c and new_file(). (me)
- nano.c:
			split checks for TERMIOS_H and TERMIO_H up so we
			can (theoretically) include them both, which is good.
handle_sigwinch():
			Added check for ncurses.h.  (Andy Kahn)
do_spell():
			We now only try ispell because we don't as of yet
			handle the 'spell' program the right way, now that
			I finally know what the right way is =-).  Added
			call to edit_update(fileage) to stop segfaults.
global_init():
			Added initialization of edit* filestruct pointers
			to stop segfaults on spell check.
usage():
			Check for getopt_long, and if no leave out the
			GNU options everyone seems to love so much (Andy Kahn)
main():
			Added checks for getopt_long (Andy Kahn)
			We ignore character 126 because it gets put into
			the buffer when we page up/down on a vt terminal.
write_file():
			Fixes for umask (Adam Rogoyski).  Renamed tmpfile
			variable to tmp.  Documented the tmp option
			better in the function comments.  Fixed my 
			stupidly commented out check for tmp on setting
			umask which I really like =>
- nano.h:
			Made desc variable in shortcut struct a pointer
			instead of a fixed-length string.
- utils.c:
			Fixed check for config.h before nano.h.
- configure.in:
			New checks for getopt_long, getopt.h, removed
			CFLAGS and LDFLAGS changes.  Gonna have to run
			strip manually now =-) (Andy Kahn)
			Added check for HAVE_WRESIZE, new file acconfig.h
			(me).

nano-0.7.9 - 01/24/2000
- New autoindent feature.  Command flag 'i' or '--autoindent'.  New
  function do_char() to clean up character output, global
  variable autoindent in global.c. (Graham Mainwaring)
- New flag 't' or '--tempfile', like Pico's -t mode, automatically saves
  files on exit without prompting.  Affects do_writeout().  Also
  do_writeout() now takes a parameter for if exiting.
  Global variable temp_opt in global.c (Graham Mainwaring)
- Preliminary spell program support.  Added command flag '-s' or
  '--speller' for alternative speller command.  Added function do_spell()
  and exit_spell() to nano.c.  New global variable alt_speller.
- nano.c:
  main():	We now ignore input of decimal 410 because these get entered 
		when we resize the screen.  Sorted options in getopt()
		switch statement.
  usage():	Sorted options and changed tabs to make room for -s option.
  write_file():	Now takes a second parameter 'tmpfile', uses mask 0600 and
		doesn't print the number of lines written on the statusbar.
  global_init():
		Added more initializations to globals to support do_spell().

nano-0.7.8 - 01/23/2000
- Stubbed justify function.  Affects main() in nano.c and nano.h defines.
- Added Fkey equivalents for Pico compatibility.  Affects nano.h defines
  and main() in nano.c
- Removed redundant reset_cursor() calls from the blank() routines.
- nano.c:
  main():	Fixed typo in main while loop for NANO_ALT_REPLACE_KEY.
		Removed check for isprint() characters in main while loop
		for people with odd character sets *shrug*.  Added some X
		window F-key combos.
  read_line():	New function, consolidates of most of the special
		sections of the file reading code. (Rob Siemborski)
  do_replace(): Many scattered fixes. (Rob Siemborski)
  write_file():	Added check for empty filename.
- winio.c:
  nanogetstr():	Fixes for deleting at places other than the end of the
		buffer, cut support. (Adam Rogoyski)
  blank_edit():	New function, blanks edit buffer.  Added call to it in 
		total_refresh().
- configure:	Checks for glib if snprintf of vsnprintf aren't available
		(Andy Kahn). Changed warning message when no termcap lib
		is found.

nano-0.7.7 - 01/19/2000
- Option '-v' for version moved to '-V', because -v is Pico's "read only"
  mode (affects getopt() in main() and usage() function in nano.c
- New flag -c, always show cursor position.  Affects main() in nano.c and
  statusbar() in winio.c
- Option '-x' doesn't show help window at the bottom of the editor.
  New variable no_help in nano.h and proto.h, affects main(), usage(),
  and global_init() in nano.c, blank_bottombars(), clear_bottomwin(),
  bottombars(), and do_yesno()  in winio.c  (I had to apply this patch by
  hand =P) (Adam Rogoyski)
- nano.c:
  handle_sigwinch():	New function (Adam Rogoyski), handles resizing.
  page_up(), page_down():	
	- New functions.  We now set the cursor at the top right corner,
	  not at the center line, and page up and down a full screen
	  rather than a half screen. Original functions renamed to
	  page_up_center() and page_down_center().
  main(): 
	- Added check for keystroke key sequence 407 or NANO_CONTROL_Z
	  in main while loop because suspend mode was broken.  This should
	  fix it, at least for now.
	- Added long option support (By popular harassment ;-) - Added
	  #include for getopt.h, changed getopt() to getopt_long().
	  Options added so far: --version (-V), --nowrap (-w), --suspend
	  (-z), --help (-h), --nohelp (-x).
	- Rewrote signal statements (Adam Rogoyski)

nano 0.7.6 - 01/15/2000
- New ChangeLog format
- nano.c: 
  main(): 	Bound CONTROL_H to backspace (oops)
		Added more Alt-[-key combinations, for page up & down.
  read_bytes():	New function (Adam Rogoyski)
  read_file():	Optimizations - malloc()s *buf a little at a time rather
		than one huge buffer, and replaced the strcat at the end
		with an index variable.  Added call to read_bytes().
  do_next_word(): New function, binding is control-space (0) (me)

- winio.c: 
  bottombars():	Fixed non-expanding shortcut keys at bottom of screen.
		(formula is extra space needed = COLS / 6 - 13).
  actual_x() & strlenpt():	
		Added bug#9 fix - when tabs % 8 == 0, we should only
		increment tabs by 1.
  titlebar():	Fixed overrun in titlebar on very long filenames.

0.7.5	Pico 'last line' feature added (Rob Siemborski & me).  Eliminated
	writing a newline at EOF. do_cursorpos and do_replace are now not
	directly bound to signals but picked up as their control sequences
	in raw mode. Bug fix in do_backspace. Fixed bug #9 (woohoo!)
0.7.4	Optimized (obfuscated?) edit_refresh. Malloc() calls checked for
	available memory, align bug fixed (Big Gaute).

--- As of version 0.7.4 TIP is renamed to nano.

0.7.3	Fixed a double blank_statusbar() when jumping to first and last
	lines.  Took out unnecessary updates in load_file. Bug fix in
	do_left. Missing updates to totlines, fixed bug #7 (last line not
	having a newline at the end doesn't get read, bugfix in do_replace
	with replace all, more/better comments (Robert Siemborski)
0.7.2	Our first patch accepted into the source! configure fixes 
	and optimizations (Erik Anderson).  Added missing stdarg.h to winio.c. 
	Bug fix in update_line for editing long lines. Fixed arguments
	being put into the filename when none is specified. Preliminary
	+line command argument function.
0.7.1	configure tweak for better FreeBSD support. Removed refresh() from
	edit_refresh to stop cursor "jumping" during screen updates.  This
	will probably cause a bug or two. Replace is now Alt-R (@R) and 
	Goto line is Alt-G (@G), but they have control key aliases of ^\ and 
	^_ respectively.  Made Control-F,B,N,P work like they do in Pico.
	Control-G will become the Help key, but for now is stubbed out.
0.7.0	Fixed missing stdlib.h from cut.c. Fixed a few message bugs in
	findnextstr. Bound Control-D to Delete. Refixed segfault on zero
	length file. Added Esc-[-A,B,C,D cursor key sequences.
0.6.9	Preliminary cursor position function. Split up tip.c more, made
	new files cut.c and winio.c. Fixed a bug in cut_marked_segment
	that was leaving out a character.
0.6.8	By request, optchr in main() is now an int.  Removed unneeded
	globals. Bound functions for next/prev page, and wrote functions
	do_home and do_end.
0.6.7	Bugfix in do_uncut_text for totlines. Broke up open_file and
	created read_file.  Implemented Insert File. Fixes in tipgetstr
	for erroneous keystrokes. Added leave_cursor arg to do_yesno().
0.6.6	Fixes in do_search(), do_replace(), do_writeout, and do_exit() for 
	aborted searches and more Pico-compatible messages. statusq() now
	returns -2 on a blank entry instead of -1. Bug fix in actual_x().
0.6.5	More BSD compatibility.  Fixed two bugs in do_uncut_text
	regarding buffers with filebot in them.  Fixins in do_backspace
	and do_enter. Removed unused variables. Removed strip_newline.
0.6.4	Took out the awful newlines from each string buffers.  This will
	certainly cause more bugs. Fixes in do_exit(). Better empty file
	handling (I hope).
0.6.3	Implemented ^E.  Removed now unneeded wrapline from filestruct.
	do_enter() rewritten.
0.6.2	Better default file permissions. Complete rewrite of do_wrap().
	Better handling of editing with cursor near COLS - 1.
0.6.1	Starting to implement wrapping toggle. Fix for unhandled control
	codes being entered into the buffer. Bug fix in actual_x; more
	> COLS - 1 functionality, especially on lines with TABs.  Fixed being 
	locked into cutbuffer when cutting more than one marked screen of
	text.
0.6.0	We have TABs!!!  To do this, placewewant is now set to the actual
	width on the screen we want to be, not an index of current->data.
	New functions xplustabs and actual_x convert the actual place
	the cursor should be on the screen to and from the place in the
	string.
0.5.5	Changed do_right to test do_down before setting current_x to 0,
	eliminating the "looping" on the last line when holding the right
	arrow.  Preliminary support for longer than COLS - 1 lines.
	Wrote do_delete.
0.5.4	Fixed a bug in total_update that wasn't repainting the screen
	properly.  tipgetstr is much more messy but text is now more
	editable ;)  Fixed crash on entering a new file, hopefully.  Awful
	stub for tab handling, only in do_right() to save me some sanity.
0.5.3	Added check for malloc.h.  Implementing uncut from marker slowly.
	Fixed a few bugs in do_uncut when not uncutting from marked text.
	I would not trust your data with the mark code right now, but then
	we're not at version 1.0 yet so dont trust anything ;)
0.5.2	Added reset_cursor() before end of update_line so cursor doesn't
	jump after each keystroke entered. Select text stubbed. Fixed
	a bug in total_refresh().  Setting a mark will highlight properly,
	but does not actually affect what gets put in the cutbuffer (yet).
0.5.1	Writing a file out causes modified to be set back to 0.  Good.
	Set_modified function written.  Cut and uncut text now set
	modified when called.
0.5.0	Half way there!  Implemented write out, save function seems
	stable.  Changed statusbar blank routing to not refresh, a separate
	program calls it and then refreshes.  Made the program not clear
	the screen on exit, just the bottom two lines (like Pico).
0.4.2	Implemented replace all in replace function.  Crude exit function
	(asks yes or no if modified but does not write to file).
0.4.1	Implementing search & replace.  Fixed crash on deleting at top of
	edit buffer.  Implemented "timeout" of statusbar messages.
	Implemented ^A and ^E (beginning and end of line).
0.4.0	Split code into global.c and proto.h to allow for better multiple
	file handling.  Added #defines for the majority of the shortcut
	keys in tip.h for easy modification. 
0.3.1	Write edit_refresh which doesn't move the screen around, just
	updates what's there already.  do_wrap() and do_enter() added.
0.3.0	Preliminary cutbuffer (cut and uncut) support.
0.2.7   Check for Modification added.  do_search() works.
0.2.5	Rewrite of file data struct.
0.2	Read in data to buffer, bound keystrokes to stub functions, 
	initial cursor movement on screen.  Initial autoconf support.
0.1	Initial program setup w/ncurses
