2009-02-15 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>

	  groff.  Fixes Savannah bug #24461: build traps on groff.  Also, add installation

        * nano.c (precalc_multicolorinfo) - Add debugging so we have a better clue if further

	  now only ask for one enter press when there is an error when not using -q.
	  Based on discussion between Eitan Adler and Mike Frysinger.
	* rcfile.c (parse_keybinding) -  Significant cleanups and fixes for 
	  detecting and reporting errors in key bindings code.

2009-02-08 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>

2009-02-05 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* More color syntax speedups:  Determine in reset_multis() whether we really need to call
	  edit_refresh().  Additional global var edit_refresh_needed() to hopefully reduce
	  repeated calls to the function.  New helper funcs reset_multis_before() and 
	  reset_multis_after().

2009-02-02 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* New color precalculation code for mult-line regexes.  New function precalc_multicolorinfo(),

	  Frysinger)

2009-01-24 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* First pass at some caching of caching color info.  Right now it's only for
	  multi-line regexes but this may not be enough to increase performance.
	* Add interruptability to search functions.  New functions enable_nodelay and
	  disable_nodelay and changes to the routines to handle checking for pending
	  searches.  Fixes Savnnah bug 24946: Need interrrupt for search.

2009-01-19 Chris Allegretta <chrisa@asty.org>
	* Change function definitions to shorts instead of (void *)s.  New mapping function

	* doc/man/nano.1, doc/man/fr/nano.1, doc/texinfo/nano.texi,
	src/*.c, src/*.h: Update copyright notices, as Chris
	Allegretta's copyrights have now been assigned to the Free
	Software Foundation.

	* files.c (username_tab_completion, cwd_tab_completion): Rename
	variable buflen to buf_len, for consistency.
	* files.c (input_tab): Disable completion of usernames,
	directories, and filenames if the cursor isn't at the end of the
	line, as it can lead to odd behavior (e.g. adding a copy of the
	entire match to the middle of the line instead of just the
	uncompleted part of the match).

2007-10-05  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* src/*.c, src/*.h: Update copyright notices, as my copyrights
	have now been assigned to the Free Software Foundation.

	file onscreen and the mark on.

2007-08-26  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

2007-08-16  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (do_insertfile): Properly handle more cases of
	inserting a file with the mark on.
	* nano.c (copy_from_file): Properly handle more cases of
	uncutting text with the mark on.

2007-08-15  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove erroneous backslash after
	ChangeLog.pre-2.1 in EXTRA_DIST, so that "make dist" works
	again.
	* files.c (do_insertfile): Make sure the mark is always properly
	positioned after inserting a file with the mark on.
	* nano.c (copy_from_file): Make sure the mark is always properly

	Goins, after uncutting one line of text with the mark on by
	properly preserving the beginning of the mark.
	* nano.c (copy_from_file): Make sure the mark is always properly
	positioned after uncutting one line of text with the mark on.

2007-08-01  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* nano.c (version): Display copyright notices.

2007-07-31  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

2007-07-11  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (copy_file): Assert that inn and out don't both point
	to the same file.

2007-07-10  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* chars.c (nstrcasestr, mbstrcasestr, revstrstr, revstrcasestr,
	mbrevstrcasestr): Simplify and rewrite to use the strncasecmp()
	equivalents.

2007-07-09  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* chars.c (nstrcasestr, mbstrcasestr, revstrstr, revstrcasestr,
	mbrevstrcasestr): Fix typo that broke the check for needle's
	being blank.
	* chars.c (mbstrncasecmp, mbstrnlen, mbstrpbrk,
	has_blank_mbchars): Simplify by using for loops instead of while
	loops where possible, to match the single-byte versions of these
	functions.
	* search.c (do_replace_loop): Fix problem where replacing e.g.
	single-byte characters with multibyte ones could result in
	openfile->totsize's being miscalculated.

2007-07-06  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* chars.c (nstrcasestr, mbstrcasestr, revstrstr, revstrcasestr,
	mbrevstrcasestr): Return char* instead of const char*.

2007-07-02  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* chars.c (nstrcasestr, mbstrcasestr, revstrstr, revstrcasestr,
	mbrevstrcasestr): For efficiency, return haystack/rev_start
	immediately if needle is blank.

2007-07-01  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	NO_HELP's being FALSE.

2007-06-28  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* browser.c (do_browser), nano.c (do_mouse), prompt.c

	processing of mouse events by consolidating if clauses.
	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Return unconditionally if we get a

	clause.

2007-05-29  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Deal with clicks of the first mouse
	button again.  Oddly, ncurses built without --enable-ext-mouse
	needs this, but ncurses built with --enable-ext-mouse doesn't.

2007-05-25  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, nano.c (main): Replace the current hackish check
	for a UTF-8 locale with a proper call to nl_langinfo().
	* winio.c (get_key_buffer): Fix inaccurate comments.

2007-05-22  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* browser.c (do_browser), nano.c (do_mouse), prompt.c
	(do_statusbar_mouse, do_yesno_prompt), winio.c (do_mouseinput):
	Simplify processing of mouse events.  Instead of calling
	wenclose() to get the window a mouse event took place in and
	manually adjusting the returned coordinates to be relative to
	that window the mouse event took place in, call wmouse_trafo(),
	which does both.

2007-05-20  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* browser.c (do_browser), nano.c (do_mouse), prompt.c
	(do_statusbar_mouse, do_yesno_prompt), winio.c (do_mouseinput):
	Fix processing of mouse events so that those we don't handle are
	ignored instead of being erroneously passed through.
	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Simplify handling of mouse events
	involving the first mouse button by only dealing with releases.
	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Improve mouse wheel support to only
	move the cursor if we're in the edit window or on the statusbar.

2007-05-15  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* winio.c (do_mouseinput): Add mouse wheel support, per Helmut
	Jarausch's suggestion.  Now, if mouse support is enabled, and
	nano is using a version of ncurses compiled with the
	--enable-ext-mouse option, rolling the mouse wheel up or down
	will move the cursor three lines up or down.

2007-04-23  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* TODO: Add entries for fixing limitations with pasting text and
	handling bad/incomplete UTF-8 sequences.

2007-04-22  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* text.c (backup_lines): Avoid a segfault when the mark begins
	and ends on the line after the last line of the paragraph.

2007-04-21  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (do_writeout): If we're in restricted mode, we're not
	allowed to write selections to files, so don't display the
	"Write Selection to File" prompt.
	* files.c (do_writeout): Simplify.

2007-04-19  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (tail): Remove unneeded if statement.

2007-04-18  John M. Gabriele  <jmg3000@gmail.com>

	* doc/faq.html: Add a new section 4.14 (with minor tweaks by
	David Lawrence Ramsey) to explain how autoindent affects pasted
	text.

2007-04-18  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (open_file): Open files using their full paths
	whenever possible, so that ~user/file.txt and "~user/file.txt"
	are treated the same way if ~user is a user's home directory.
	* files.c (real_dir_from_tilde): Simplify.
	* files.c (do_writeout): Properly display the warning in all
	cases if we try to save (a) an existing file under a different
	name, or (b) a file with no name under an existing file's name.
	* files.c (do_writeout): Rename variable different_name to
	do_warning, for clarity.
	* rcfile.c (parse_include): Open files using their full paths
	whenever possible, so that ~user/file.txt and "~user/file.txt"
	are treated the same way if ~user is a user's home directory.
	* rcfile.c (parse_include): Properly check for the included
	file's being a directory, a character file, or a block file.
	* rcfile.c (parse_include): For consistency, display the
	filename as the user entered it if we can't read the specified
	file.
	* winio.c (parse_kbinput): Interpret Cancel and Shift-Cancel.
	* winio.c (get_escape_seq_kbinput): Add missing comments.

2007-04-17  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (real_dir_from_tilde): Fix long-standing problem,
	found by Justin Fletcher, where directory names that began with
	"~", but that weren't users' home directories, could be
	erroneously treated as users' home directories (e.g. "~d/" would
	be treated as "~daemon/").
	* files.c (input_tab): Don't bother checking if num_matches is
	less than zero, as it's a size_t and hence unsigned.

2007-04-16  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* files.c (real_dir_from_tilde): Fix segfault, found by Justin
	Fletcher, when dealing with directory names that begin with "~",
	but that aren't users' home directories.

2007-04-11  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@gentoo.org>

	* doc/syntax/asm.nanorc, doc/syntax/c.nanorc,
	doc/syntax/sh.nanorc: Copy the regex that highlights trailing
	whitespace (with minor tweaks by David Lawrence Ramsey) from
	doc/syntax/java.nanorc to these files, as it's also useful in
	them.

2007-04-04  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@gmail.com>

	* AUTHORS, faq.html: Update email address.
	* winio.c (get_escape_seq_kbinput): Add escape sequences for
	Terminal.

2007-02-01  Benno Schulenberg  <bensberg@justemail.net>

	* global.c (shortcut_init): Reword the movement shortcut
	descriptions so that they use "Go to" instead of "Move to",
	since not all of them move the cursor in the same way.
	* global.c (shortcut_init): Reword the paragraph movement
	shortcut descriptions to more accurately describe how they work.
	* nano.c (usage): Reword the description of the -S/--smooth
	command line option in order to differentiate it from the
	associated toggle description.

2007-01-29  David Lawrence Ramsey  <pooka109@cox.net>

	* ChangeLog: Rework the 2.1 branch's changelog to be more
	readable, per Jordi Mallach's suggestion.
	* ChangeLog.pre-2.1: Move the 2.0 branch's changelog here, per
	Jordi Mallach's suggestion.
	* Makefile.am: Add ChangeLog.pre-2.1 to EXTRA_DIST.
	* src/help.c (help_init): Add a missing space to the "Execute
	Command" help text.
